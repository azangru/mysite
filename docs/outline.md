Turns out, I can't even plan a website for myself. I keep procrastinating. Here's what I want:


- Blog section. Long articles
  - Dark thoughts?
- Notes or diary section. Short articles. Good examples:
  - https://thathtml.blog
- Links
- RSS feed
- About page
- Resume page?




Directory structure
  - blog
    - year
      - article
  - notes
    - year
      - month
        - note
