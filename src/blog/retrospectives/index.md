Checklist to reflect on how daily scrums are going:
We have a Daily Scrum, and...
The entire Development Team fully participates and achieves the purpose within the time-box.
The Daily Scrum is a collaborative planning session facilitated by the Development Team.
By the end of the Daily Scrum, the Development Team understands the progress made toward the Sprint Goal, any impediments blocking or slowing progress, and the plan for the next 24 hours.
The Daily Scrum is not simply a status update, but actively facilitates collaboration to help improve the ability of the team to deliver value.
