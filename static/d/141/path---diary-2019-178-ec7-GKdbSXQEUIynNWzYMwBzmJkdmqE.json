Couldn’t make it work with <code class=\"language-text\">npm link</code>, but the technique using <code class=\"language-text\">npm pack</code> turned out to be very reliable. The idea is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>first, run <code class=\"language-text\">npm pack</code> in the directory of the npm package you are testing;</li>\n<li>second, change to the directory of the project in which you want to test this package, and run <code class=\"language-text\">npm install &lt;path to the package&gt;</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Works like a charm!</p>\n<h2>January 20</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>A <a href=\"https://youtu.be/ifGeR-4mzSM\">video course</a> that someone copied from Egghead about using very hardcore (Haskell-inspired) functional javascript to write a guessing card game.
