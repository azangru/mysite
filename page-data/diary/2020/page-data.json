Several days passed, and the post started requiring the reader to log in to read the text (that’s a dick move, Medium). I recovered the questions from that post (and related posts) through some googling, and thought I will copy them here. At least they won’t be paywalled here.</p>\n<h3>From Microsoft online interview</h3>\n<h4>Question 1</h4>\n<p>Write a function <code class=\"language-text\">solution</code> that, given a string S of N lowercase English letters, returns a string with no instances of three identical consecutive letters, obtained from S by deleting the minimum possible number of letters.</p>\n<p>Examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Given S = <code class=\"language-text\">eedaaad</code> , the function should return <code class=\"language-text\">eedaad</code>. One occurrence of letter a is deleted.</li>\n<li>Given S = <code class=\"language-text\">xxxtxxx</code>, the function should return <code class=\"language-text\">xxtxx</code>. Note that letter x can occur more than three times in the returned string, if the occurrences are not consecutive.</li>\n<li>Given S = <code class=\"language-text\">uuuuxaaaaxuuu</code>, the function should return <code class=\"language-text\">uuxaaxuu</code>.\nWrite an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:</li>\n<li>N is an integer within the range [1..200,000]</li>\n<li>string S consists only of lowercase letters (a-z)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Question 2</h4>\n<p>Write a function <code class=\"language-text\">solution</code> that, given an array A consisting of N integers, returns the maximum sum of two numbers whose digits add up to an equal sum. If there are no two numbers whose digits have an equal sum, the function should return -1.</p>\n<p>Examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Given A = [51, 71, 17, 42], the function should return 93. There are two pairs of numbers whose digits add up to an equal sum: (51, 42) and (17, 71). The first pair sums up to 93.</li>\n<li>Given A = [42, 33, 60], the function should return 102. The digits of all the numbers in A add up to the same sum, and choosing to add 42 and 60 gives the result 102.</li>\n<li>Given A = [51, 32, 43], the function should return -1, since all numbers in A have digits that add up to different, unique sums.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>N is an integer within the range [1..200,000]</li>\n<li>each element of array A is an integer within the range [1..1,000,000,000]</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Question 3</h4>\n<p>You are given a string S consisting of N letters ‘a’ and/or ‘b’. In one move, you can swap one letter for the other (‘a’ for ‘b’ or ‘b’ for ‘a’).</p>\n<p>Write a function <code class=\"language-text\">solution</code> that, given such a string S, returns the minimum number of moves required to obtain a string containing no instances of three identical consecutive letters.</p>\n<p>Examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Given S = <code class=\"language-text\">baaaaa</code>, the function should return 1. The string without three identical consecutive letters which can be obtained in one move is <code class=\"language-text\">baabaa</code>.</li>\n<li>Give S = <code class=\"language-text\">baaabbaabbba</code>, the function should return 2. There are four valid strings obtainable in two moves: for example, <code class=\"language-text\">bbaabbaabbaa</code>.</li>\n<li>Given S = <code class=\"language-text\">baabab</code>, the function should return 0.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>N is an integer within the range [0..200,000]</li>\n<li>string S consists only of the characters ‘a’ and/or ‘b’</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>From Google’s online assessment for entry-level developers</h3>\n<h4>Question 1</h4>\n<p>In a row of trees, the i-th tree produces fruit with type tree[i].</p>\n<p>You start at any tree of your choice, then repeatedly perform the following steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Add one piece of fruit from this tree to your baskets. If you cannot, stop.</li>\n<li>Move to the next tree to the right of the current tree. If there is no tree to the right, stop.</li>\n<li>Note that you do not have any choice after the initial choice of starting tree: you must perform step 1, then step 2, then back to step 1, then step 2, and so on until you stop.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>You have two baskets, and each basket can carry any quantity of fruit, but you want each basket to only carry one type of fruit each.</p>\n<p>What is the total amount of fruit you can collect with this procedure?</p>\n<p>Example 1:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">Input: [1,2,1]\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: We can collect [1,2,1].</code></pre></div>\n<p>Example 2:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">Input: [0,1,2,2]\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: We can collect [1,2,2].\nIf we started at the first tree, we would only collect [0, 1].</code></pre></div>\n<p>Example 3:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">Input: [1,2,3,2,2]\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: We can collect [2,3,2,2].\nIf we started at the first tree, we would only collect [1, 2].</code></pre></div>\n<p>Example 4:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">Input: [3,3,3,1,2,1,1,2,3,3,4]\nOutput: 5\nExplanation: We can collect [1,2,1,1,2].\nIf we started at the first tree or the eighth tree, we would only collect 4 fruits.</code></pre></div>\n<p>Note:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>1 &#x3C;= tree.length &#x3C;= 40000</li>\n<li>0 &#x3C;= tree[i] &#x3C; tree.length</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Question 2</h4>\n<p>There is a special keyboard with all keys in a single row.</p>\n<p>Given a string keyboard of length 26 indicating the layout of the keyboard (indexed from 0 to 25), initially your finger is at index 0. To type a character, you have to move your finger to the index of the desired character. The time taken to move your finger from index i to index j is |i - j|.</p>\n<p>You want to type a string <code class=\"language-text\">word</code>.

Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.</p>\n<p>Suppose you have n versions [1, 2, …, n] and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.</p>\n<p>You are given an API bool isBadVersion(version) which will return whether version is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API.</p>\n<p>Example:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">Given n = 5, and version = 4 is the first bad version.\ncall isBadVersion(3) -&gt; false\ncall isBadVersion(5) -&gt; true\ncall isBadVersion(4) -&gt; true\nThen 4 is the first bad version.</code></pre></div>\n<h4>Medium</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Design a data structure that supports the following two operations:</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">void addWord(word)\nbool search(word)</code></pre></div>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">search(word)</code> can search a literal word or a regular expression string containing only letters <code class=\"language-text\">a-z</code> or <code class=\"language-text\">.</code>. A <code class=\"language-text\">.</code> means it can represent any one letter.</p>\n<p>Example:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">addWord(&quot;bad&quot;)\naddWord(&quot;dad&quot;)\naddWord(&quot;mad&quot;)\nsearch(&quot;pad&quot;) -&gt; false\nsearch(&quot;bad&quot;) -&gt; true\nsearch(&quot;.ad&quot;) -&gt; true\nsearch(&quot;b..&quot;) -&gt; true</code></pre></div>\n<p>Note:\nYou may assume that all words are consist of lowercase letters a-z.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Given a 2d grid map of <code class=\"language-text\">1</code>s (land) and <code class=\"language-text\">0</code>s (water), count the number of islands.
