An episode of Agile for Humans from 2015 — [Agility with Allen Holub](https://youtu.be/hVF0u1WLf2E). Brings up some earnest questions, especially in the beginning — e.g. what is agile, does it even mean anything, what's the relation of scrum to agile, does the product owner role make sense, does management make sense, etc.

## May 10
An interesting [website](https://georgefrancis.dev/) with writing on generative SVG art.

## April 06
The [`media-chrome`](https://github.com/muxinc/media-chrome) web component for a video player affords a lot of learning opportunities.

## April 05
Today I learned that the community seems to be upset with JSON web tokens and advocate for a different standard, e.g. [paseto](https://paseto.io/).

## April 04
Ok, [this site of a web studio](https://www.sennep.com/) is very cool. Despite them using React, and despite the many animations, it feels buttery smooth. Looks great, is a pleasure to read, and is quite snappy.

## March 29
CSS wizardry:
- Someone [built](https://twitter.com/cobra_winfrey/status/1375888420011188226) a 3d CSS model of a cargo ship.
- A [twitch stream](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/966414970) showing a similar feat
- [Web page](https://jhey.dev/) of the streamer with lots of cool stuff in it.

## March 16
- The Front-End Developer Learning Roadmap, by Cody Lindley, sponsored by Frontend Masters, is a surprisingly good resource of its kind.
- Eric Meyer's [site](https://meyerweb.com/) — love it!
- Andy Bell runs [his own microblog](https://andy-bell.co.uk/). Great idea!

## February 27
Great [article](https://piccalil.li/tutorial/improve-the-readability-of-the-content-on-your-website) about the styles for better readability of text-rich sites.

## February 7
Just re-watched the Supercharged [episode](https://youtu.be/_ZQOUQsw_YI) about WebGL, and appreciated it so much more this time. A great introduction into the topic.

## February 3
- [CleverCloud/clever-components](https://github.com/CleverCloud/clever-components) — collection of web components that may be interesting to explore
- [three-elements](https://github.com/hmans/three-elements) — Three.js in web components (similar to react-three-fiber)
- The site of [Fueled](https://fueled.com/) (seems to be built with Vue) is mildly interesting as far as their routing behavior is concerned

## January 13
An [article](https://www.kirillvasiltsov.com/writing/how-to-create-a-spring-animation-with-web-animation-api/) discussing how to create spring animations with the Web Animation API.

## January 7
Ben Lesh [talks](https://youtu.be/cx9sHuEgLrI) at RxJS Live (September 2020) about the improvements in RxJS v7 compared to v6.
