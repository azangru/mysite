One of the things that really strikes me is that there are things that are alleged as, you know, traitorous illegal activities that, if you had asked me, is this traitorous or illegal, I would have said: "Doesn’t sound like it to me." For example, if the Russians had some dirt on Hillary, and if they offered it to the campaign, if you had asked me, without this news coverage in which we all learned how this works, is it illegal to gather information from someone who has information, I would say: "How is that illegal to talk to people? Why would it be illegal to know more, if it’s true, why would it be illegal to have true information?"
