Some interesting ideas on using ReasonML alongside React in a brown-field project
already written in JS. [Article](https://dev.to/fiber_god/enable-reasonml-in-any-react-app-5bl2)
and a [sample repo](https://github.com/fiber-god/one-punch-fitness).

## January 17
[Reddit discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/7qq91b/what_do_i_have_to_learn_to_do_this/)
on how to do "goey stuff" in CSS.

A workable solution for using ReactDND (a drag-and-drop) library on touch
devices that do not have the html5 drag-and-drop api present on the desktop.
The project is called [dnd-multi-backend](https://github.com/LouisBrunner/dnd-multi-backend),
and its React implementation actually works.

Also, absent videos from 2017's Nodevember, here’s a
[repository](https://github.com/tysoncadenhead/coffee-ratios) with a demonstration
of refactoring a typically structured React app into a more functional equivalent
using Recompose and Ramda.

And a repo with code from Eric Baer’s talk
[GraphQL For The Rest Of Us: New Things for People Who Work On Old Things](https://github.com/baer/graphql-demo-graphql-for-the-rest-of-us) —
this looks exciting!

[Hot Reload All the Things](https://hackernoon.com/hot-reload-all-the-things-ec0fed8ab0)
along with the [companion GitHub repository](https://github.com/mhaagens/hot-reload-all-the-things)
seems worth exploring.

## January 4
[Reactivity](https://github.com/madeagency/reactivity) — an interesting practical
example of using bleeding-edge React technologies, such as:
- server-side streaming with `renderToNodeStream`;
- code splitting with `react-universal-component`;
- `redux-observable` with server-side rendering (thanks to `react-redux-epic`).

## January 3
[Razzle](https://github.com/jaredpalmer/razzle), an interesting project that
generates universal JavaScript apps.

And an interesting [example](https://joelgardner.github.io/2017-07-13/part5-bnb-book-frontend-react-redux-saga/)
of combining redux-saga with Apollo (without using React-Apollo)
