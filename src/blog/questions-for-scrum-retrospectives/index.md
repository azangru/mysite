# Questions for retrospectives on the Scrum processes

## For daily scrum
- What is the purpose of the daily scrum?
- What are your expectations of the daily scrum?
  - What is/are the most important question(s) that you want answered when you come to the daily scrum?
- On the scale of 0 to 5, how satisfied are you with the way we run the daily scrum?

### Quotations
“By the end of the Daily Scrum, every Development Team member should understand progress toward the Sprint Goal, the current plan for achieving it, and the likelihood of achieving it. In addition, team members should know what they plan to accomplish in the next 24 houes and how they will work together to accomplish it.”

(From _Mastering Professional Scrum_, by Stephanie Ockerman and Simon Reindt)

### Checklist
We have a Daily Scrum, and...
- The entire Development Team fully participates and achieves the purpose within the time-box.
- The Daily Scrum is a collaborative planning session facilitated by the Development Team.
- By the end of the Daily Scrum, the Development Team understands the progress made toward the Sprint Goal, any impediments blocking or slowing progress, and the plan for the next 24 hours.
- The Daily Scrum is not simply a status update, but actively facilitates collaboration to help improve the ability of the team to deliver value.
