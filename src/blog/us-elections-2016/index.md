title: On the 2016 US Presidential elections and the Russian meddling
date: "2018-04-07"

## Preamble
Although I wanted to write down my thoughts about the accusations that Russia meddled
in the 2016 US Presidential elections, I was _very_ slow about it. So slow that
when I watched the [debate](https://youtu.be/LsY70_uIXNc) between Glenn Greenwald and
James Risen on this topic, I felt that I could hardly add anything to Greenwald’s argument —
he expressed my thoughts much more persuasively than I ever could. Besides, the
issue of Russian meddling has since faded from the news somewhat, and the itch to reflect
on the topic became less and less urgent. There has, however, recently been another
scandal involving Russia, which had certain similarities to the meddling-related episode,
and thus stimulated the itch.


## My Background and Possible Bias
Through most of my life I’ve been happily apolitical, and generally unaware of
hot topics discussed in the society. Perhaps the focus on the studies (or work, or games,
or tech) helped: I did not have either time or interest to follow the news or listen
to political commentators. Here in Russia, I completely missed the news cycle of 1996
presidential elections (when Yeltsin was re-elected, reportedly in a rather dirty manner),
or the ascent of Putin to the position of prime minister, or his elections in 2000, and so on.
Ditto for US or British politicians: I was mildly amused by how George W. Bush was
shown in cartoons, or by the excitement around having the first African American president,
but that’s about it.

It could have been Jon Stewart’s *The Daily Show*, or it could have been *Unfilter* by
Jupiter Broadcasting (a podcasting company that also ran *Linux Action Show*, which I was
much more interested in at the time) that gradually made me aware of the current
political topics. I think that happened some time between 2010 and 2014.
Which means that the US presidential campaign of 2016 was probably the first campaign
the news of which I followed closely.

Of all the candidates in that campaign, I really liked Bernie Sanders. Especially
after hearing his [victory speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kbjo3SFLuc) after
the New Hampshire Democratic primary. To me, he seemed like a sincere man, proclaiming noble
goals, having a sharp mind and no desire to play the regular political games. He
projected fairness and trustworthiness. He was very likable. It’s a shame that he
had to lose.

The two main candidates both seemed very unlikable. I had missed the news that
caused Hillary to be generally despised (was it something to do with Benghazi? or something before
that?), but for me the one episode that was enough was her [response](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MaoNDzZ8Mw)
to a journalist’s question whether she had "wiped the server" [containing her emails,
before submitting it to the FBI]. Her response was, "What, with a cloth or something?"
The journalist persisted: "You know how it works digitally", to which she replied:
"I do not know how it works digitally at all". This exchange showed her to be either an
outright liar or an outrageously technologically illiterate person. The prevalent sentiment
that she should become a president *because* she was a woman (pinnacled by Madeleine Albright famous
["There is a special place in hell for women who don’t help each other"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZCNhlmV-X0&t=30s))
didn’t help.

While Clinton was coming across as an insincere actress,
Trump gave an impression of a complete idiot. Particularly drastic was the contrast
between him and Bernie when both were giving their victory speeches in New Hampshire.
Bernie talked about issues; Trump talked about himself. Bernie was eloquent; Trump,
incoherent. And yet, the closer the election date, the more I wanted Trump to win —
if only to disrupt the status quo and to make things more fun to watch from afar.
My argument would have been similar to what Slavoj Zizek [articulated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZUCemb2plE):

> It was a very cynical reasoning. Because my hope was precisely that if Trump
> was elected president, everyone would be shocked, horrified at this horror, and
> something will happen, like Bernie Sanders and so on, in the Democratic party.

Living in Russia, I got used to despising our government, not listening to what
they have to say, and retreating into my private life, hoping never to become an object
of attention from the state. I thought it would be cool if more people across the
world would learn to ignore their governments. Although it probably doesn’t quite work
that way, as Jono Bacon pointed out:

> This is the thing that drives me nuts about people... Look, I don't like Trump,
> I can't stand him, I think he is an idiot; but on one hand you have people saying
> "He is such an idiot, he says such stupid shit", and then people say,
> in the next breath, "But look at what he said."

So yeah, here they are, my biases that can cloud my judgement in what I am going
to say below: I am Russian, and I disliked Hillary more than I disliked Trump. Having
said that, I shall move on to what drives me insane about this election — the story
of Russian meddling.

## The Russian Meddling

Before proceeding further, let me say this. I understand there are laws. They may
cover cases that I discuss and qualify them as a crime. I did not study them.
I am talking here as a layman, expecting the world to work a certain way and
being disappointed when it doesn’t. I’m sure that’s OK.

Also, my quarrel is not with the facts. I am not trying to prove that Russia hasn't
meddled in the elections. I do not know enough to decide one way or the other, and
I have long since given up on Russia. My quarrel is solely with the discourse;
with how this is presented in the news or in the social media, with how this is
talked about.

### Complaint #1: Russia wanted Trump to win and used its media to scare voters away from Hillary

Some critics would point at RT, the Russia-sponsored cable news channel, and say that it
bashed Hillary and gave air time to Jill Stein thus stealing the voters away from Hillary.
In fact, this is a part of the [Intelligence Community Assessment](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICA_2017_01.pdf) of
Russia's activities during 2016 elections (section _Russian Propaganda Efforts_).

I completely fail to see the problem with this. Firstly, I am completely OK with RT
having a political agenda, even if this makes it into Kremlin's mouthpiece.
The point, as I see it, is to have a diversity of media, not
to ensure the universal absence of bias among the media. If a media outlet is biased against a candidate,
it will more eagerly publish materials damaging to that candidate. That means that the audience
will have at their disposal materials that they otherwise might not have. If factual, such
materials are valuable, because, as I think many would agree, knowing the facts is better than
not knowing them. It is the viewer's job (if the viewer cares enough to undertake it)
to decide whether they are persuaded, one way or the other, by the channel's materials,
and perhaps to compare them with the coverage on other channels. Participating in the democratic
process requires a mental effort; let the viewer make it.

> Like, think for yourself, like, have critical thinking skills, you know what I mean?
> And I always tell them, you know, I'd much rather know the bias right in front of me —

> about Russia

> ([Abby Martin, interview about her work on RT](https://youtu.be/OuLKIN1KVfs?t=8m40s))

Some would argue that Russian backing automatically means a candidate is bad, to which I say,
nonsense. Certainly, it's reasonable to expect Russia to be pursuing its own interests,
and it is also understandable (though sad) to regard Russia as an adversary, but is it so unfeasible
to imagine that a candidate is both better for their own country _and_ more preferable for the
Russians? For example, it is reasonable to expect that the US (and probably the rest of
the world) would much rather see the liberal opposition to Putin come to power in Russia.
Does this fact discredit the liberal opposition in any way? I would say, not in the slightest.
The candidate should be assessed by his or her own merits, not by what other nations think of them.


### Complaint #2: Russians met with the Trump campaign to provide them with materials hurting Hillary

This one, as far as I heard, would have fallen under certain specific provisions in the US law
making this action criminal. Also, judging by the results of investigations so far,
it hasn't really happened. But again, naive layman that I am, I fail to see the problem
in the proposition.

Imagine there are candidate A and candidate B. Imagine candidate A has done something
unseemly. Imagine there is evidence of that action, but it is in
possession of another country. Imagine that that said country does not like
candidate A and wants them to lose the race; so it supplies candidate B with
the evidence that can be used against candidate A. Now, as a potential voter,
choosing between candidate A and candidate B, would you be interested in learning
what candidate A has actually done? I know I would. The fact that your interest in
making an informed decision when choosing between the candidates, and another
country's interest to remove candidate A may coincide is, in my layman's opinion,
only that, coincidental.

I appreciate that I may be an uncivilized brute from an authoritarian culture who is not
trained in the ways of democracy, so I was pleasantly surprised to hear westerners
express similar views. Here is Scott Adams, of Dilbert fame:

> One of the things that really strikes me is that there are things that are alleged as,
> you know, traitorous illegal activities, that, if you had asked me, is this traitorous or illegal,
> I would have said: "Doesn’t sound like it to me." For example, if the Russians had some dirt
> on Hillary, and if they offered it to the campaign, if you had asked me,
> without this news coverage in which we all learned how this works,
> is it illegal to gather information from someone who has information,
> I would say: "How is that illegal to talk to people? Why would it be illegal to know more,
> if it’s true, why would it be illegal to have true information?"

> ([Scott Adams, in The Rubin Report](https://youtu.be/4_idhCca2XM?t=19m39s))

And here’s Glenn Greenwald:

> So, let’s say that it [collusion] meant simply that the Russians told Trump:
> "Hey, we have this dirt on Hillary Clinton that we’d like to give you."
> If Trump of Trump Junior or anyone in the Trump campaign said "Oh, you have dirt
> on our opponent, and you want to give it to us? Sure, we’d like to take that,"
> would that be a crime? Would that mean that Trump is an agent of Russian government?
> _The Politico_ has this really great story that they wrote after the election,
> in which they reported that Ukrainian officials met with and worked with a contractor
> for the DNC to give dirt about Donald Trump to the Clinton campaign,
> and the DNC and the Clinton campaign eagerly accepted it,
> because of course you accept dirt about your political opponent, no matter where it comes from.

> ([Glenn Greenwald, in his debate with James Risen on The Intercept](https://youtu.be/LsY70_uIXNc?t=20m40s))

### Complaint #3: Russians made fake accounts on social media to sow discord among American voters and to influence there opinions

This one, as well as the scandal around _Cambridge Analytica_ on a similar basis,
is puzzling to me. If people are so excitable, so fickle, so inconstant, and so easily
influenced that some random dude's ramblings or some ads they see on social media
would change their minds, don’t we have a larger problem? Should’t those pointing their finger
at Facebook, at Russia, or at Cambridge Analytica just scream with fear? Because
what they are essentially saying is that that voters have no brains, no convictions
and no persuasions of their own, and whoever shouts the loudest or pays the most
during an election campaign will win the election. Which means democracy is nothing
but a figment of imagination (which it very well might be anyway).

Polly Boiko puts it better than me in her [episode](https://youtu.be/Jw_RXwgxEKg)
of _In Case You Missed It_ on _Cambridge Analytica_.

### Complaint #4: Russia hacked the DNC and John Podesta’s emails and passed all that to Wikileaks

This is a big topic that can be divided into two separate issues: one is the hacking itself,
and the other is its consequences.

Now, obviously, hacking into a system is not cool. It is even less cool if you are
a government agency hacking into an agency of a different government. It is hostile.
It is ugly. It is scandalous. No doubt about it.

The thing is though that we as a public have not been shown convincing evidence
that demonstrates, beyond a doubt, that it was Russia that did the hacking. We
have not been given any explanation of _how exactly_ this conclusion was reached.

This doesn’t mean that Russia didn’t do it. I appreciate that there may be secrets
that US agencies that issued the [report](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICA_2017_01.pdf)
on the Russian activities during the 2016 elections are not willing to share with
general public. This is understandable. But lacking the concrete evidence, lacking
the step-by-step explanation of the evidence and interpretation of what it means,
the only thing that we have to go by is the authority of these agencies.
They are essentially asking the public to just trust them. This is not how reasonable
people should persuade each other. If they cannot, or will not, show the evidence,
fine; but that means they cannot expect blind trust in return.

Glenn Greenwald made a similar point, but focusing on the known intelligence fiasco
about Iraq:

> The lesson [of Iraq War] is that we shouldn’t believe claims from the US government
> absent convincing evidence, meaning not anonymous sources inside of government
> making assertions without underlying corroboration, but actual tangible evidence
> that we can see and assess for ourselves.

> ([Glenn Greenwald, in his debate with James Risen on The Intercept](https://youtu.be/LsY70_uIXNc?t=24m08s))

Now for the second point: the immediate result of the hacking. As a result of the leaked
emails, the public was shown specific unethical behaviors of the DNC (sabotaging the Sanders’
campaign, sharing debate questions with Clinton beforehand), which the public would
not have known about otherwise. Even if the published emails have been chosen for the
damage they could do, weren’t they describing actual facts? And isn’t knowing the
facts better than not knowing them, when making informed decisions?

## The British Poisoning Scandal: Similarities

> Her favorite position is beside herself, and her favorite sport is jumping to conclusions.
>
> _(From Daniel Kahneman's Thinking Fast and Slow; attributed to comedian Danny Kaye)_

On 4 March 2018, a former Russian intelligence officer and his daughter were found
poisoned in Salisbury, UK. On March 12, a week later, Theresa May announced that the poisoning
agent came from Russia, and that it was "highly likely" that the poisoning was ordered by Russia.

These are the only explanations that the public was given before expulsion of the
Russian diplomats began. It was not given any information that would allow
anyone with sufficient knowledge and reasoning powers
to independently assess the strength of the evidence and the inevitability of
conclusions. This is understandable: perhaps the formula of the
poison is supposed to be a secret (although the chemical structure of the substances
of this group is openly available on Wikipedia); perhaps the ways that the British
laboratories identified it are a secret — I don’t know. But the result is: there
is no way for the general public to know which part of the statements about the
poisoning is true and which is false; which is supported by evidence and which is
speculative. This makes the case very similar to the DNC hack, where the claim
also was never supported by exact evidence.

Compare this with the case of Alexander Litvinenko. There is a whole
[web site](http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160613090305/https://www.litvinenkoinquiry.org/)
(now archived), _litvinenkoinquiry.org_, dedicated exclusively to the public inquiry into his death.
It contains all the evidence presented at the inquiry, as well as the eventual
report made by the inquiry chairman. This is a wonderful example of how the public
should be treated. Yes, it took 10 years until the results of the inquiry were published;
but at least they were, and now everyone can familiarize themselves with the details
of that case, and assess how convincing the arguments are. Why not do the same for
Skripal case? Why all the rush?
