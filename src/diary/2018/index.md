1. A [repo](https://github.com/alex/what-happens-when) explaining — in great detail — what happens
    when the user requests a page in the browser. As the author explains, it is:
  > An attempt to answer the age old interview question "What happens when you type google.com into your browser and press enter?"

2. This article has long sat neglected in one of my browser tabs; I am not sure it’s practical,
but still the approach is interesting:
[React + Redux + React Router 4 code splitting w/ RxJS & Webpack](https://medium.com/@luigiplr/react-redux-react-router-4-code-splitting-w-rxjs-webpack-32eabedf0e9)

Some ideas about testing epics in redux-observable:

- [article 2](https://dev.to/julioolvr/writing-tests-for-redux-observable)

## February 11
[Universal web boilerplate](https://github.com/dtonys/universal-web-boilerplate) is a really
nice starter kit that has universal rendering and code splitting, and also uses redux-saga
for async effects handling.

## February 3
James Gillmore, aka @faceyspacey, the creator of redux-first-router, is a passionate person.
I don’t know whether this his characterization of React opinion leaders is fair, but
he might have a point. Anyway, I chuckled:

> As far as Redux, RFR [redux-first-router] is hands down the best routing solution for Redux apps.
> It also offers the best SSR solution. RFR is king. U don’t hear much about it
> because React influencers don’t build apps. They do open source and build Kittle React sites
> to showcase their work. So they don’t need Redux. When was the last time u heard Kent Dodds
> talk about a Redux app he was building. In short only real programmers on the ground are tasked
> to building large Redux apps soup to nuts. And if u work at a big company like Kent, ie PayPal,
> ur sole responsibility is like a single page with a Dropshift dropdown, or ur in charge of like
> their open source division or something. So none of these people really know Redux.
> The guy who writes the Redux docs, acemark, doesn’t even do routing on his day job so he knows
> nothing about it. They are all missing out and ultimately know nothing about modern Redux as a result.
> RFR is king, never use React Router if ur building a Redux app.

## January 29
Several courses by Harvard’s CS50 team that might be of interest:
- [Mobile App Development with React Native](https://cs50.github.io/mobile/)
- [Web Programming with Python and JavaScript](https://cs50.github.io/web/)
- [Introduction to Game Development](https://cs50.github.io/games/)

They look pretty basic, but still...

## January 21
Some interesting ideas on using ReasonML alongside React in a brown-field project
already written in JS. [Article](https://dev.to/fiber_god/enable-reasonml-in-any-react-app-5bl2)
and a [sample repo](https://github.com/fiber-god/one-punch-fitness).

## January 17
[Reddit discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/7qq91b/what_do_i_have_to_learn_to_do_this/)
on how to do "goey stuff" in CSS.

## January 6
A workable solution for using ReactDND (a drag-and-drop) library on touch
devices that do not have the html5 drag-and-drop api present on the desktop.
The project is called [dnd-multi-backend](https://github.com/LouisBrunner/dnd-multi-backend),
and its React implementation actually works.

Also, absent videos from 2017's Nodevember, here’s a
[repository](https://github.com/tysoncadenhead/coffee-ratios) with a demonstration
of refactoring a typically structured React app into a more functional equivalent
using Recompose and Ramda.

And a repo with code from Eric Baer’s talk
[GraphQL For The Rest Of Us: New Things for People Who Work On Old Things](https://github.com/baer/graphql-demo-graphql-for-the-rest-of-us) —
this looks exciting!

## January 5
[Hot Reload All the Things](https://hackernoon.com/hot-reload-all-the-things-ec0fed8ab0)
along with the [companion GitHub repository](https://github.com/mhaagens/hot-reload-all-the-things)
seems worth exploring.

## January 4
[Reactivity](https://github.com/madeagency/reactivity) — an interesting practical
example of using bleeding-edge React technologies, such as:
- server-side streaming with `renderToNodeStream`;
- code splitting with `react-universal-component`;
- `redux-observable` with server-side rendering (thanks to `react-redux-epic`).

## January 3
[Razzle](https://github.com/jaredpalmer/razzle), an interesting project that
generates universal JavaScript apps.

And an interesting [example](https://joelgardner.github.io/2017-07-13/part5-bnb-book-frontend-react-redux-saga/)
of combining redux-saga with Apollo (without using React-Apollo)
