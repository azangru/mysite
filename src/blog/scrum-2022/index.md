In August 2020, when the work had gone remote, members of ouur team had a chance to take a 2-day professional scrum master training with a scrum.org trainer Andy Hiles. Since then, we have been trying to integrate the scrum framework into the way we work. Here's an overview of how it's been going.

## A bird’s-eye view of scrum
It all begins with a product. The purpose for a group of people getting and working together is to make sure that the product happens. The product must have some value, or it wouldn’t have needed to be built. There are probably people out there who waiting for this product — we call them stakeholders. There are hopefully people in your organization that keep their eye on the product and understand its value and its purpose. A scrum team needs access to this person; and the scrum framework calls him the product owner.

The product is probably fairly complex and can‘t be hacked together in a day or two — otherwise, there wouldn't have been a need for inventing a process for how to get there. The whole point of scrum is identifying a group of people that can build the product — that’s the cross-functional, self-managing scrum team, — slicing up the path to the product into small pieces — that’s product backlog items, — completing a certain number of items on a regular basis — that’s the sprint; – and then regularly taking a step back to check whether the product is still being built appropriately and in the right order — what’s commonly mentioned as inspecting and adapting.

The scrum framework recognizes three roles — or, as they are called since the 2020 update, accountabilities – within a Scrum team. These are the developers, the product owner, and the scrum master. The product owner carries the vision of the product, has the domain knowledge, and understands the value that the product brings; he is thus the sole authority in deciding which product features have to be delivered in what order. The developers then build the product. The scrum master makes sure that scrum happens. This, judging by the sheer volume of literature about the scrum master’s role, is the most mysterious role.

## The name
As a historical aside, although the authorship of the scrum framework is ascribed to Jeff Sutherland and Ken Schwaber, it was two Japanese authors, Hirotaka Takeuchi and Ikujiro Nonaka, who published an article in Harward Business Review in 1986, which anticipated the whole agile movement in software of the later decades. In that article, they used a sports metaphor to contrast the relay race – which has since become familiar as the waterfall model of development — with a rugby scrum, in which “the ball gets passed within the team as it moves as a unit up the field.”

## The sprint
The purpose of doing work in sprints is to establish a regular cadence of work. It allows for biting off a chunk of work, working on it, and then inspecting the results of the work. The Scrum Guide prescribes that a sprint take no longer than 1 month. Our team holds two-week sprints; although occasionally, when there are holidays, we would have a couple of 3-week sprints and then would continue at our regular 2-week schedule.

The scrum guide insists that a sprint must have a goal. In fact, the latest, 2020 edition of the Scrum Guide, has put more emphasis on the intentionality of work done during scrum. Thus, it suggests that the product has a defined product goal, and each sprint has a defined sprint goal.

Ideally, a sprint goal should communicate why a sprint is valuable. Ideally, there should be only one goal for a sprint, which would help the development team focus on this goal. This was puzzling for us until we found in the scrum literature the permission to take tasks into a sprint that do not relate to the goal, provided that the goal exists and that it takes priority as the most crucial purpose of the sprint.

Learning: while a sprint goal is important, not all work taken in a sprint must pertain to the sprint goal.

## Sprint review
 The end of a sprint would be a natural place to inspect the results of the work done during the sprint — this is called a product increment — and to 

No product owner; no stakeholders.
