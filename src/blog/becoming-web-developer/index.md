## The Story
We all have our stories of how we ended up doing what we do. Here is mine.

I started late (an ever-present reason to feel guilty for being so hesitant and slow).
I got my own personal computer when I was 16; and for a long time regarded programming
as something extremely clever approachable only to the mathematically minded. I remember
thinking longingly, around the time I graduated from the high school, how awfully smart were
the guys who were about to enter the School of Computational Mathematics and Cybernetics
at the Moscow State University. Myself, I went to a medical school. I had been preparing
for it for two years, and at the time it seemed like the only practical option.

I pivoted twice exploring what I wanted to do with my life. The first pivot happened a couple of
years after I graduated from the medical school (yes, I completed all six years of medical
training, slowly realizing that I had no intention of practicing medicine). I was
working at a genetics laboratory in Denmark, going through the depressing everyday routine of
mixing solutions for molecular reactions and getting frustrated by experiment after unsuccessful
experiment. That was the time when I first dabbled with web development. Our university
had a free license for _Adobe GoLive_ (it was 2004, I believe); our laboratory needed
a web page; so I tried to put something together. The result was pretty horrible.
Luckily, it never went online.

My main distraction from the depressingly unsuccessful lab work at that time was translation.
I had started translating medical texts from English into Russian while still studying at the med school,
but I had also begun translating fiction (thanks to Ekaterina Dobrohotova-Maikova, who encouraged
my early attempts, and to Vladimir Bakanov, who gave me books to translate). So by the time I
eventually snapped and quit the lab, my ambition was to translate. And for that,
I thought, I needed a proper training. A training in the humanities, and especially
in my native language that I was translating into, i.e. in Russian. So I went ahead
and applied to the School of Philology at the Moscow State University, department of the Russian
language and Russian literature. To my amazement and delight, I was accepted.

That, I realize in retrospect, was a mistake. An education in linguistics improves
one’s understanding of how language works, and disabuses one of various common misconceptions,
but does very little in terms of improving one’s translation skills. Instead of spending five rather
interesting years in studies of various aspects of the Russian language and the history of the
Russian literature, as I ended up doing, I could have probably discovered my passion for programming much
earlier. Sadly, by now, five years after graduation, I have forgotten most of whatever philology
I learned, and am reminded of that period mostly by nightmares, in which I am about to take
an exam on literature, but had not read a thing.

This brings me to my second pivot. Looking back, I recognize it for the trivial cliché that is was,
but at the time I was blissfully unaware that this was exactly what numerous unsatisfied
middle-aged people were doing. Still, looking back at it, it feels surreal, and I can hardly believe
I managed to pull it off. Working part-time as a proofreader for a digital agency, I learned about
a company they had once been partners with, called _General Assembly._ General Assembly had
established a number of coding bootcamps internationally, and was advertising its Web Development
courses. Among various campuses there was one in London, to which I applied and — miraculously —
got accepted. Another miracle happened at the British border, due to an irregularity in my papers.
The thing was that General Assembly, being a private company and not an academic institution,
was not in a position to support me in receiving an academic visa, while a regular tourist visa
had a (then unknown to me) limitation regarding the number of days one could study while in Britain.
The limit was 30 days, while the bootcamp’s duration was 3 months. All that I learned in an
interrogation room at a British airport. Incredibly, unbelievably I was let through,
with a stern warning never to do so again.

So, from April to July 2014 I studied at General Assembly’s Web Development Immersive program
designed to prepare full-stack web developers. It started with backend development,
focusing on ruby and the Ruby-on-Rails framework, and then proceeded to frontend development,
teaching us some JavaScript, Coffeescript, jQuery, Underscore.js, and, as a finishing touch, a
little bit of Backbone.js. Those were perhaps the happiest months in my life. I was in London,
a place where I had most wished to be, hearing people speak the language I most wished to hear,
learning a new profession that promised to be empowering, challenging, and well-paid.
It was only when I returned to Russia and started applying to jobs and getting rejected
that I realized how little I knew and how junior a developer I was. “We are not looking
for junior developers,” was a standard reply. So I was relieved when I finally received
an offer from a small startup working on a script that could be embedded in other
sites and would show an invitation to share the web page after the user would do
a certain action (such as scroll to the end of the page or click on a link to navigate
away from the page). Yes, that sounds pretty awful and intrusive, and something that
I as a visitor to that web site would not appreciate, I know; and for that I am sorry.
On the plus side though I did get some real-world experience. I am also happy to report
that that particular project has since gone out of business.

My work at that startup, as well as my... should I say remote internship, for the lack
of a better word, at a US-based company _EHR.works,_ made me realize that I needed — no, I
wanted — to learn more JavaScript; that the training I got at the bootcamp was very
much insufficient, and that some seriously interesting stuff was happening in frontend
development, which was constantly changing and becoming more and more logic-intensive.
So in the summer of 2015 I took another three-month course at a coding bootcamp — this
time remotely and focusing exclusively on JavaScript development.

The training I received at that second bootcamp, US-based _Hack Reactor_, along with
the experience I got during my first junior year, allowed me to get a job as a frontend
developer first at _Rutube_ (a Russian video streaming company, which at some point
viewed itself as a direct competitor of Youtube; hence the name), and then at
_Bookmate,_ where I am currently employed.
