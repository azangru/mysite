## December 31
- [Scrum Interview Questions and Answers](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWcvFkRbuunn534zhHAQ0pn0uJ2sCXgjo) — a playlist by what looks like an Indian company, iZenBridge Consultancy.

Things worth researching related to Three.js:
- An [example](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/master/examples/webgl_loader_pdb.html) of use of the old PDBLoader for Three.js
- Someone’s [attempt](https://github.com/JensKrumsieck/CIFLoader3/blob/master/CIFLoader.js) to create a similar CIF loader. Not sure what it does; most likely same as the PDB loader (i.e. only deals with atoms and bonds).
- [glmol.js](https://github.com/biochem-fan/GLmol/blob/master/src/js/GLmol.js) — an old attempt to also represent protein molecules using the ir pdb data
- [icn3d](https://github.com/ncbi/icn3d) — NCBI’s protein structure viewer, which uses Three.js; although its codebase is horrible.

## December 30
- Saw an [article](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmolb.2022.831740/full) on the NCBI 3d molecule viewer, ICn3D, which seems to be based on Three.js. Here’s a [link](https://github.com/ncbi/icn3d) to their repository.
