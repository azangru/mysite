Hi!

My name is Andrey, and this website is my little personal space on the Internet.

I work as a web developer — frontend, mostly. I get easily excited by the words
such as JavaScript (accompanied by the names of whatever latest features of the language
happen to be the most hyped up at the moment), React (accompanied by such words as functional programming,
stateless components, recompose, server-side rendering, etc.), RxJS, progressive
web apps, and so on.

Now a quick tour around the site. For me, it serves the purpose of social media, only without
the "social" part. The [diary](/diary/) section is something of a microblog (and tends
to morph into a collection of useful links found during the day that I would
like to be reminded about), while the [blog](/blog/) section takes care of lengthier scrivenings.
No mechanism is provided for leaving comments. Hello Web 1.0, my old friend!

I am a bit of an anglophile — no matter which part of the English-speaking
world this "anglo-" is coming from, — and there was a period in my life when
I nourished this passion by translating medical textbooks and fiction from English
into Russian. The list of these translations, which can be found on the
[publications](/publications/) page, reminds me of those fond times. (Eventually,
I took pity both on the authors and on the readers, and decided to indulge my passion
in a more harmless manner).

What I am most emphatically *not*, as must be painfully obvious from the first glance
at the site, is a designer. To all those whose esthetic feelings I offend by
the choice (or lack thereof) of typeface, or font-size, or font color, or by page layout,
or by myriads of other details, I apologize. At work, my hands would be guided by
a professional designer, but here I am left to my own devices.
