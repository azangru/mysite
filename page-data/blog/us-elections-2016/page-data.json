So slow that\nwhen I watched the <a href=\"https://youtu.be/LsY70_uIXNc\">debate</a> between Glenn Greenwald and\nJames Risen on this topic, I felt that I could hardly add anything to Greenwald’s argument —\nhe expressed my thoughts much more persuasively than I ever could. Besides, the\nissue of Russian meddling has since faded from the news somewhat, and the itch to reflect\non the topic became less and less urgent. There has, however, recently been another\nscandal involving Russia, which had certain similarities to the meddling-related episode,\nand thus stimulated the itch.</p>\n<h2>My Background and Possible Bias</h2>\n<p>Through most of my life I’ve been happily apolitical, and generally unaware of\nhot topics discussed in the society. Perhaps the focus on the studies (or work, or games,\nor tech) helped: I did not have either time or interest to follow the news or listen\nto political commentators. Here in Russia, I completely missed the news cycle of 1996\npresidential elections (when Yeltsin was re-elected, reportedly in a rather dirty manner),\nor the ascent of Putin to the position of prime minister, or his elections in 2000, and so on.\nDitto for US or British politicians: I was mildly amused by how George W. Bush was\nshown in cartoons, or by the excitement around having the first African American president,\nbut that’s about it.</p>\n<p>It could have been Jon Stewart’s <em>The Daily Show</em>, or it could have been <em>Unfilter</em> by\nJupiter Broadcasting (a podcasting company that also ran <em>Linux Action Show</em>, which I was\nmuch more interested in at the time) that gradually made me aware of the current\npolitical topics. I think that happened some time between 2010 and 2014.\nWhich means that the US presidential campaign of 2016 was probably the first campaign\nthe news of which I followed closely.</p>\n<p>Of all the candidates in that campaign, I really liked Bernie Sanders. Especially\nafter hearing his <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kbjo3SFLuc\">victory speech</a> after\nthe New Hampshire Democratic primary. To me, he seemed like a sincere man, proclaiming noble\ngoals, having a sharp mind and no desire to play the regular political games. He\nprojected fairness and trustworthiness. He was very likable. It’s a shame that he\nhad to lose.</p>\n<p>The two main candidates both seemed very unlikable. I had missed the news that\ncaused Hillary to be generally despised (was it something to do with Benghazi? or something before\nthat?), but for me the one episode that was enough was her <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MaoNDzZ8Mw\">response</a>\nto a journalist’s question whether she had “wiped the server” [containing her emails,\nbefore submitting it to the FBI]. Her response was, “What, with a cloth or something?”\nThe journalist persisted: “You know how it works digitally”, to which she replied:\n“I do not know how it works digitally at all”. This exchange showed her to be either an\noutright liar or an outrageously technologically illiterate person. The prevalent sentiment\nthat she should become a president <em>because</em> she was a woman (pinnacled by Madeleine Albright famous\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZCNhlmV-X0&#x26;t=30s\">“There is a special place in hell for women who don’t help each other”</a>)\ndidn’t help.</p>\n<p>While Clinton was coming across as an insincere actress,\nTrump gave an impression of a complete idiot. Particularly drastic was the contrast\nbetween him and Bernie when both were giving their victory speeches in New Hampshire.\nBernie talked about issues; Trump talked about himself. Bernie was eloquent; Trump,\nincoherent. And yet, the closer the election date, the more I wanted Trump to win —\nif only to disrupt the status quo and to make things more fun to watch from afar.\nMy argument would have been similar to what Slavoj Zizek <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZUCemb2plE\">articulated</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It was a very cynical reasoning. Because my hope was precisely that if Trump\nwas elected president, everyone would be shocked, horrified at this horror, and\nsomething will happen, like Bernie Sanders and so on, in the Democratic party.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Living in Russia, I got used to despising our government, not listening to what\nthey have to say, and retreating into my private life, hoping never to become an object\nof attention from the state. I thought it would be cool if more people across the\nworld would learn to ignore their governments. Although it probably doesn’t quite work\nthat way, as Jono Bacon pointed out:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This is the thing that drives me nuts about people… Look, I don’t like Trump,\nI can’t stand him, I think he is an idiot; but on one hand you have people saying\n“He is such an idiot, he says such stupid shit”, and then people say,\nin the next breath, “But look at what he said.”</p>\n<p>(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/ZS7a0CW7nUs?t=1h1m4s\">Bad Voltage, season 2, episode 24</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So yeah, here they are, my biases that can cloud my judgement in what I am going\nto say below: I am Russian, and I disliked Hillary more than I disliked Trump. Having\nsaid that, I shall move on to what drives me insane about this election — the story\nof Russian meddling.</p>\n<h2>The Russian Meddling</h2>\n<p>Before proceeding further, let me say this. I understand there are laws. They may\ncover cases that I discuss and qualify them as a crime. I did not study them.\nI am talking here as a layman, expecting the world to work a certain way and\nbeing disappointed when it doesn’t. I’m sure that’s OK.</p>\n<p>Also, my quarrel is not with the facts. I am not trying to prove that Russia hasn’t\nmeddled in the elections. I do not know enough to decide one way or the other, and\nI have long since given up on Russia. My quarrel is solely with the discourse;\nwith how this is presented in the news or in the social media, with how this is\ntalked about.</p>\n<h3>Complaint #1: Russia wanted Trump to win and used its media to scare voters away from Hillary</h3>\n<p>Some critics would point at RT, the Russia-sponsored cable news channel, and say that it\nbashed Hillary and gave air time to Jill Stein thus stealing the voters away from Hillary.\nIn fact, this is a part of the <a href=\"https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICA_2017_01.pdf\">Intelligence Community Assessment</a> of\nRussia’s activities during 2016 elections (section <em>Russian Propaganda Efforts</em>).</p>\n<p>I completely fail to see the problem with this. Firstly, I am completely OK with RT\nhaving a political agenda, even if this makes it into Kremlin’s mouthpiece.\nThe point, as I see it, is to have a diversity of media, not\nto ensure the universal absence of bias among the media. If a media outlet is biased against a candidate,\nit will more eagerly publish materials damaging to that candidate. That means that the audience\nwill have at their disposal materials that they otherwise might not have. If factual, such\nmaterials are valuable, because, as I think many would agree, knowing the facts is better than\nnot knowing them. It is the viewer’s job (if the viewer cares enough to undertake it)\nto decide whether they are persuaded, one way or the other, by the channel’s materials,\nand perhaps to compare them with the coverage on other channels. Participating in the democratic\nprocess requires a mental effort; let the viewer make it.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Like, think for yourself, like, have critical thinking skills, you know what I mean?\nAnd I always tell them, you know, I’d much rather know the bias right in front of me —\nRussia Today, you can navigate around it if you feel you are not getting the truth per se\nabout Russia</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/OuLKIN1KVfs?t=8m40s\">Abby Martin, interview about her work on RT</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Some would argue that Russian backing automatically means a candidate is bad, to which I say,\nnonsense. Certainly, it’s reasonable to expect Russia to be pursuing its own interests,\nand it is also understandable (though sad) to regard Russia as an adversary, but is it so unfeasible\nto imagine that a candidate is both better for their own country <em>and</em> more preferable for the\nRussians? For example, it is reasonable to expect that the US (and probably the rest of\nthe world) would much rather see the liberal opposition to Putin come to power in Russia.\nDoes this fact discredit the liberal opposition in any way? I would say, not in the slightest.\nThe candidate should be assessed by his or her own merits, not by what other nations think of them.</p>\n<h3>Complaint #2: Russians met with the Trump campaign to provide them with materials hurting Hillary</h3>\n<p>This one, as far as I heard, would have fallen under certain specific provisions in the US law\nmaking this action criminal. Also, judging by the results of investigations so far,\nit hasn’t really happened. But again, naive layman that I am, I fail to see the problem\nin the proposition.</p>\n<p>Imagine there are candidate A and candidate B. Imagine candidate A has done something\nunseemly. Imagine there is evidence of that action, but it is in\npossession of another country. Imagine that that said country does not like\ncandidate A and wants them to lose the race; so it supplies candidate B with\nthe evidence that can be used against candidate A. Now, as a potential voter,\nchoosing between candidate A and candidate B, would you be interested in learning\nwhat candidate A has actually done? I know I would. The fact that your interest in\nmaking an informed decision when choosing between the candidates, and another\ncountry’s interest to remove candidate A may coincide is, in my layman’s opinion,\nonly that, coincidental.</p>\n<p>I appreciate that I may be an uncivilized brute from an authoritarian culture who is not\ntrained in the ways of democracy, so I was pleasantly surprised to hear westerners\nexpress similar views. Here is Scott Adams, of Dilbert fame:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>One of the things that really strikes me is that there are things that are alleged as,\nyou know, traitorous illegal activities, that, if you had asked me, is this traitorous or illegal,\nI would have said: “Doesn’t sound like it to me.” For example, if the Russians had some dirt\non Hillary, and if they offered it to the campaign, if you had asked me,\nwithout this news coverage in which we all learned how this works,\nis it illegal to gather information from someone who has information,\nI would say: “How is that illegal to talk to people? Why would it be illegal to know more,\nif it’s true, why would it be illegal to have true information?”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/4_idhCca2XM?t=19m39s\">Scott Adams, in The Rubin Report</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And here’s Glenn Greenwald:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>So, let’s say that it [collusion] meant simply that the Russians told Trump:\n“Hey, we have this dirt on Hillary Clinton that we’d like to give you.”\nIf Trump of Trump Junior or anyone in the Trump campaign said “Oh, you have dirt\non our opponent, and you want to give it to us? Sure, we’d like to take that,”\nwould that be a crime? Would that mean that Trump is an agent of Russian government?\n<em>The Politico</em> has this really great story that they wrote after the election,\nin which they reported that Ukrainian officials met with and worked with a contractor\nfor the DNC to give dirt about Donald Trump to the Clinton campaign,\nand the DNC and the Clinton campaign eagerly accepted it,\nbecause of course you accept dirt about your political opponent, no matter where it comes from.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/LsY70_uIXNc?t=20m40s\">Glenn Greenwald, in his debate with James Risen on The Intercept</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Complaint #3: Russians made fake accounts on social media to sow discord among American voters and to influence there opinions</h3>\n<p>This one, as well as the scandal around <em>Cambridge Analytica</em> on a similar basis,\nis puzzling to me. If people are so excitable, so fickle, so inconstant, and so easily\ninfluenced that some random dude’s ramblings or some ads they see on social media\nwould change their minds, don’t we have a larger problem? Should’t those pointing their finger\nat Facebook, at Russia, or at Cambridge Analytica just scream with fear? Because\nwhat they are essentially saying is that that voters have no brains, no convictions\nand no persuasions of their own, and whoever shouts the loudest or pays the most\nduring an election campaign will win the election. Which means democracy is nothing\nbut a figment of imagination (which it very well might be anyway).</p>\n<p>Polly Boiko puts it better than me in her <a href=\"https://youtu.be/Jw_RXwgxEKg\">episode</a>\nof <em>In Case You Missed It</em> on <em>Cambridge Analytica</em>.</p>\n<h3>Complaint #4: Russia hacked the DNC and John Podesta’s emails and passed all that to Wikileaks</h3>\n<p>This is a big topic that can be divided into two separate issues: one is the hacking itself,\nand the other is its consequences.</p>\n<p>Now, obviously, hacking into a system is not cool. It is even less cool if you are\na government agency hacking into an agency of a different government. It is hostile.\nIt is ugly. It is scandalous. No doubt about it.</p>\n<p>The thing is though that we as a public have not been shown convincing evidence\nthat demonstrates, beyond a doubt, that it was Russia that did the hacking. We\nhave not been given any explanation of <em>how exactly</em> this conclusion was reached.</p>\n<p>This doesn’t mean that Russia didn’t do it. I appreciate that there may be secrets\nthat US agencies that issued the <a href=\"https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICA_2017_01.pdf\">report</a>\non the Russian activities during the 2016 elections are not willing to share with\ngeneral public. This is understandable. But lacking the concrete evidence, lacking\nthe step-by-step explanation of the evidence and interpretation of what it means,\nthe only thing that we have to go by is the authority of these agencies.\nThey are essentially asking the public to just trust them. This is not how reasonable\npeople should persuade each other. If they cannot, or will not, show the evidence,\nfine; but that means they cannot expect blind trust in return.</p>\n<p>Glenn Greenwald made a similar point, but focusing on the known intelligence fiasco\nabout Iraq:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The lesson [of Iraq War] is that we shouldn’t believe claims from the US government\nabsent convincing evidence, meaning not anonymous sources inside of government\nmaking assertions without underlying corroboration, but actual tangible evidence\nthat we can see and assess for ourselves.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/LsY70_uIXNc?t=24m08s\">Glenn Greenwald, in his debate with James Risen on The Intercept</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Now for the second point: the immediate result of the hacking. As a result of the leaked\nemails, the public was shown specific unethical behaviors of the DNC (sabotaging the Sanders’\ncampaign, sharing debate questions with Clinton beforehand), which the public would\nnot have known about otherwise. Even if the published emails have been chosen for the\ndamage they could do, weren’t they describing actual facts? And isn’t knowing the\nfacts better than not knowing them, when making informed decisions?</p>\n<h2>The British Poisoning Scandal: Similarities</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Her favorite position is beside herself, and her favorite sport is jumping to conclusions.</p>\n<p><em>(From Daniel Kahneman’s Thinking Fast and Slow; attributed to comedian Danny Kaye)</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>On 4 March 2018, a former Russian intelligence officer and his daughter were found\npoisoned in Salisbury, UK. On March 12, a week later, Theresa May announced that the poisoning\nagent came from Russia, and that it was “highly likely” that the poisoning was ordered by Russia.</p>\n<p>These are the only explanations that the public was given before expulsion of the\nRussian diplomats began. It was not given any information that would allow\nanyone with sufficient knowledge and reasoning powers\nto independently assess the strength of the evidence and the inevitability of\nconclusions. This is understandable: perhaps the formula of the\npoison is supposed to be a secret (although the chemical structure of the substances\nof this group is openly available on Wikipedia); perhaps the ways that the British\nlaboratories identified it are a secret — I don’t know. But the result is: there\nis no way for the general public to know which part of the statements about the\npoisoning is true and which is false; which is supported by evidence and which is\nspeculative. This makes the case very similar to the DNC hack, where the claim\nalso was never supported by exact evidence.</p>\n<p>Compare this with the case of Alexander Litvinenko. There is a whole\n<a href=\"http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160613090305/https://www.litvinenkoinquiry.org/\">web site</a>\n(now archived), <em>litvinenkoinquiry.org</em>, dedicated exclusively to the public inquiry into his death.\nIt contains all the evidence presented at the inquiry, as well as the eventual\nreport made by the inquiry chairman. This is a wonderful example of how the public\nshould be treated. Yes, it took 10 years until the results of the inquiry were published;\nbut at least they were, and now everyone can familiarize themselves with the details\nof that case, and assess how convincing the arguments are. Why not do the same for\nSkripal case? Why all the rush?</p>\n<h2>Post Scriptum</h2>\n<p>On July 07, 2018, the US Department of Justice announced indictments against 12 Russians\nfor hacking the DNC. The text of the indictment is available for anyone interested on the\n<a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/file/1080281/download\">justice.gov website</a>. This was\nprobably the first detailed description of the available evidence made open\nto public scrutiny. To me, this marks the date only after which public debate\nabout the Russian involvement should have started, because prior to that the factual\nbasis for such an allegation was kept secret from the public.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"On the 2016 US Presidential elections and the Russian meddling","date":"07 April, 2018"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/blog/us-elections-2016/"}}}
