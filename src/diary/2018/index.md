# November 30
A wonderful [talk](https://youtu.be/Qsoj4s_Ml6s) by Chris Toomey from Thoughtbot about client-side GraphQL
given at React Boston 2018 (in September), and the [sample app](https://github.com/christoomey/boston-react-conf-2018-graphql-talk)
that goes along with it.

Also, Youtube followed it with another interesting talk, about an experience of using GraphQL in production,
titled [GraphQL - A Production Retrospective](https://youtu.be/HVuSi5pVC1U). It's mostly about the server-side
staff, something people rarely give talks about.

## November 25
- There is an Apollo GraphQL [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0pEW_GOrMJ23l8QcrGdKSw/videos),
but it does not (yet?) have videos from the recent [GraphQL Summit 2018](https://summit.graphql.com/#agenda-1).
Hopefully, they will add the videos at some point.
- Also, noticed the [repo](https://github.com/apollographql/fullstack-tutorial) with a sample full-stack
GraphQL app for the [Apollo tutorial](https://github.com/apollographql/fullstack-tutorial).

## November 24
- [33-js-concepts](https://github.com/leonardomso/33-js-concepts) might be an interesting repository collecting
various resources on various JavaScript concepts; for example a link to all GoF design patterns implemented
in JS looks interesting.
- Also, came across videos on the [NDC conferences](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTdw38Cw6jcm0atBPA39a0Q/videos)
channel.

## November 21
Ben Lesh’s talk [Complex Features Made Easy with RxJS](https://youtu.be/B-nFj2o03i8)

## November 18
Wow, tons of interesting talks to watch and keep up with
- Obviously, [ReactConf 2018](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz5vTaEhvh7dOHEyd1efcaQ/videos)
- Just as obviously, [Chrome Dev Summit 2018](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNYkxOF6rcIDjlCx1PcphPpmf43aKOAdF)

- Andre Staltz's [talk](https://youtu.be/NH-bL6Bd7Tw?t=16372) about using profunctor
lenses for state management (with an example using React)
- And, as if the above wasn’t enough, there are also talks from React Boston 2018
[released](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEvOJSbEEBkXw40FqHGPVRA/videos) during the previous week
- Oh, and there also was [ReactiveConf 2018](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBHdUnixTWymmXBIw12Y8Qg/videos)
 during the last days of October! Completely missed it!
- And there are lots of new videos on Smashing Magazine’s [Vimeo channel](https://vimeo.com/smashingmagazine)
- Also, it looks like JSConf US 2018 has [released](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL37ZVnwpeshGGVeMxXxCxjQZBJq5bqM7b)
its videos

[CSS guidelines](https://cssguidelin.es/) are an interesting document, although they might refer
to the slightly outdated practices of writing CSS.

## August 30
John Resig is co-authoring a book about GraphQL. I don't know his co-author; meanwhile this co-author

home about, but some portions of it may be interesting to review.

## April 12
A [Gitbook](https://legacy.gitbook.com/book/chrisnoring/rxjs-5-ultimate/details)
on RxJS by Chris Norig. Might be worth a look.

## April 5
Found the [spec.fm](https://spec.fm/podcasts/) site with various podcasts for developers.

## March 31
Mike North’s [repo](https://github.com/mike-works/sql-fundamentals) for his courses
(an introductory and a more advanced ones) about relational databases for frontend developers.

## March 18
James Gillmore’s (skeptical) opinion on the upcoming Suspense feature of React, and of the new
React’s context api – [here](https://gitter.im/Reactlandia/Lobby?at=5a9d321853c1dbb743a68a92)
and [here](https://gitter.im/Reactlandia/Lobby?at=5a9f72706f8b4b9946fa0a2b).

I like his passion. Don’t know if he’ll turn out to be right, but his thoughts are
definitely interesting.

## March 9
[Layout land](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7TizprGknbDalbHplROtag/videos) — CSS-related
videos by Mozilla’s Jen Simmons.

## March 8
Atlassian’s [react-beautiful-dnd](https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd) looks pretty
slick!

## March 7
Talks from [Assert(js)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ66c9_z3umNSrKSb5cmpxdXZcIPNvKGw) — a
conference about testing (focused primarily on JavaScript).

## March 3
Had to specifically install `kio-mtp` on KDE Neon to enable phone file system browsing from the laptop
and copying files from the desktop to the SD card. The need to install a specific package for this
was unexpected. Luckily, with this package installed everything works perfectly.

Also, it takes to install `vim-gui-common` package to enable vim clipboard sharing with other X applications.

P.S.: I switched from vanilla Ubuntu to KDE neon a couple of weeks ago, after Chris Fisher
reminded me of this option with his [tweet](https://twitter.com/chrislas/status/960002530041241600).
The transition went smoothly, and I am really loving the new Plasma interface.

## February 18
1. A [repo](https://github.com/alex/what-happens-when) explaining — in great detail — what happens
    when the user requests a page in the browser. As the author explains, it is:
  > An attempt to answer the age old interview question "What happens when you type google.com into your browser and press enter?"

2. This article has long sat neglected in one of my browser tabs; I am not sure it’s practical,
but still the approach is interesting:
[React + Redux + React Router 4 code splitting w/ RxJS & Webpack](https://medium.com/@luigiplr/react-redux-react-router-4-code-splitting-w-rxjs-webpack-32eabedf0e9)

## February 17
Some ideas about testing epics in redux-observable:
- [article 1](https://medium.com/kevin-salters-blog/writing-epic-unit-tests-bd85f05685b)
- [article 2](https://dev.to/julioolvr/writing-tests-for-redux-observable)

## February 11
[Universal web boilerplate](https://github.com/dtonys/universal-web-boilerplate) is a really
nice starter kit that has universal rendering and code splitting, and also uses redux-saga
for async effects handling.

## February 3
James Gillmore, aka @faceyspacey, the creator of redux-first-router, is a passionate person.
I don’t know whether this his characterization of React opinion leaders is fair, but
he might have a point. Anyway, I chuckled:

> As far as Redux, RFR [redux-first-router] is hands down the best routing solution for Redux apps.
> It also offers the best SSR solution. RFR is king. U don’t hear much about it
> because React influencers don’t build apps. They do open source and build Kittle React sites
> to showcase their work. So they don’t need Redux. When was the last time u heard Kent Dodds
> talk about a Redux app he was building. In short only real programmers on the ground are tasked
> to building large Redux apps soup to nuts. And if u work at a big company like Kent, ie PayPal,
> ur sole responsibility is like a single page with a Dropshift dropdown, or ur in charge of like
> their open source division or something. So none of these people really know Redux.
> The guy who writes the Redux docs, acemark, doesn’t even do routing on his day job so he knows
> nothing about it. They are all missing out and ultimately know nothing about modern Redux as a result.
> RFR is king, never use React Router if ur building a Redux app.

## January 29
Several courses by Harvard’s CS50 team that might be of interest:
- [Mobile App Development with React Native](https://cs50.github.io/mobile/)
- [Web Programming with Python and JavaScript](https://cs50.github.io/web/)
- [Introduction to Game Development](https://cs50.github.io/games/)

They look pretty basic, but still...

## January 28
[Data Science at the Command Line](https://www.datascienceatthecommandline.com/)

## January 21
Some interesting ideas on using ReasonML alongside React in a brown-field project
already written in JS. [Article](https://dev.to/fiber_god/enable-reasonml-in-any-react-app-5bl2)
and a [sample repo](https://github.com/fiber-god/one-punch-fitness).

## January 17
[Reddit discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/7qq91b/what_do_i_have_to_learn_to_do_this/)
on how to do "goey stuff" in CSS.

## January 6
A workable solution for using ReactDND (a drag-and-drop) library on touch
devices that do not have the html5 drag-and-drop api present on the desktop.
The project is called [dnd-multi-backend](https://github.com/LouisBrunner/dnd-multi-backend),
and its React implementation actually works.

Also, absent videos from 2017's Nodevember, here’s a
[repository](https://github.com/tysoncadenhead/coffee-ratios) with a demonstration
of refactoring a typically structured React app into a more functional equivalent
using Recompose and Ramda.

And a repo with code from Eric Baer’s talk
[GraphQL For The Rest Of Us: New Things for People Who Work On Old Things](https://github.com/baer/graphql-demo-graphql-for-the-rest-of-us) —
this looks exciting!

## January 5
[Hot Reload All the Things](https://hackernoon.com/hot-reload-all-the-things-ec0fed8ab0)
along with the [companion GitHub repository](https://github.com/mhaagens/hot-reload-all-the-things)
seems worth exploring.

## January 4
[Reactivity](https://github.com/madeagency/reactivity) — an interesting practical
example of using bleeding-edge React technologies, such as:
- server-side streaming with `renderToNodeStream`;
- code splitting with `react-universal-component`;
- `redux-observable` with server-side rendering (thanks to `react-redux-epic`).

## January 3
[Razzle](https://github.com/jaredpalmer/razzle), an interesting project that
generates universal JavaScript apps.

And an interesting [example](https://joelgardner.github.io/2017-07-13/part5-bnb-book-frontend-react-redux-saga/)
of combining redux-saga with Apollo (without using React-Apollo)
