It took me a while to realize where my interest truly lies. I started as a medical student, and actually worked through the whole six years of the medical school, by the end of which I was pretty sure I donâ€˜t want to be a doctor. I tried research, and worked for a couple of years on a molecular genetics laboratory in Denmark... but felt that was not it either. By that time, I had already become interested in translation and, working in spare time, had translated several books. As the lab routine was getting more and more boring, I was getting that idea that I wanted to become a translator, so eventually I decided to study my own language and literature.
