For example, currently the English language enjoys the situation when a huge\n(perhaps the largest) number of book titles, or journals, or films are released in this language. Consequently,\nanyone who understands English has access to all this wealth of knowledge and culture. If (a hypothetical scenario)\na language disappeared, and people who might have spoken it instead joined the pool of English speakers,\nit would have more (in absolute terms) people who could generate knowledge and share it in this language.</p>\n<p>(Compare whatever is currently published in Russian with whatever is published in English — the latter is much\nmore abundant and important.)</p>\n<h2>Example</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>The cost of global English</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The global spread of English is not without controversy. While English often brings economic advantage it can also affect the relative status of other languages. In the case of English being used as an official language in countries where it is not (or was not traditionally) a native language (e.g. Ghana), this can create numerous problems. &#x3C;…></p>\n<ul>\n<li>In countries where English is established as an official language, speakers of the indigenous languages of that country can become alienated as their national identity is threatened by the dominance of English.</li>\n<li>The dominance of English in former British colonial countries can lead the colonised people to ‘internalize the norms of the colonizers’ — that is, to absorb the social, political, and cultural views of the colonial power. This can result in the loss of local cultures and customs.</li>\n<li>The use of English in such countries sustains the dominance of the usually small governing elite.\nAdded to these problems, of course, [is] … the fact that English often leads to the dying out of many of the world’s lesser known languages.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>(from Dan McIntyre.

In August, Belarus holds a presidential election, which have been largely judged as unfair. The people begin protesting, and to disrupt coordination between the protesters, the Belarussian government shuts down a sizeable portion of the country’s internet. This, of course, is unacceptable for Belarussian IT workers who rely on fast and stable internet in order to do their daily work. Articles appear that Belarussian IT specialists start fleeing the country. But where would they go? One option is Lithuania; another is Poland; another is Germany. Each country has its own language. In order to become a full-functioning member of the society in these countries, one must learn those languages.\n(<a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24392905\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24392905</a>)</p>\n<h2>Example</h2>\n<p>You are reading a book or watching a movie. Only it has originally been written or shot in a foreign language, and what you are experiencing is a translation. Which means that now are intermediaries between you and the original product — possibly one in case of a book, almost inevitably a whole team in case of a movie. The intermediaries who can distort various aspects of the original, from the meaning of the text to the delivery of the dialogue.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"On linguistic diversity","date":"01 July, 2018"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/language-diversity/"}}}
