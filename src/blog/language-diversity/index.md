## Language Diversity

The fewer languages there are, the more knowledge is accumulated in the remaining languages, and the fewer barries
there are for accessing this knowledge. For example, currently the English language enjoys the situation when a huge
(perhaps the largest) number of book titles, or journals, or films are released in this language. Consequently,
anyone who understands English has access to all this wealth of knowledge and culture. If (a hypothetical scenario)
a language disappeared, and people who might have spoken it instead joined the pool of English speakers,
it would have more (in absolute terms) people who could generate knowledge and share it in this language.

(Compare whatever is currently published in Russian with whatever is published in English â€” the latter is much
more abundant and important.)
