Below are some scrum-related questions from a [forum thread](https://www.scrum.org/forum/scrum-forum/35525/psm-iii-sample-questions-review-and-feedback) about exam questions for the PSM III certificate. They aren’t lifted off of an actual exam question bank; but are sufficiently interesting that I thought I’d have a go at answering them.  


<h2 class="question">
<span>Question:</span>
One of the Scrum events is the Sprint Review. How does the Sprint Review enable empiricism? What would the impact be if some members of the development team were not present? 
</h2>

Empiricism means being guided by experience and by observation of the state of the world as it stands; and no other Scrum event embodies the spirit of empiricism better than the Sprint Review. In it, the Scrum team gets together with the stakeholders to inspect the increment added to the product over the course of the last sprint, and the state of the product as it currently is. It also offers an opportunity to reflect on the world in the context of which the product is being built. Over the course of the Sprint Review, the Scrum Team gets feedback on whether the stakeholders believe that the team is building the right product; whether they are building it correctly; and whether any of the priorities in the building of the product have changed. This allows the Scrum Team to correct their course early and to avoid wasted effort.

Ideally, all members of the Scrum Team should be present at the Sprint Review. Of course the presence of the Product Owner is crucial; because he is the person responsible for the direction in which the product is going, and for the order in which it is being built. But developers benefit from this event too. It is when they get a chance to collectively reflect on the development of the product as a whole; to better understand its place in the world; to listen to stakeholders; to ask them questions; and to better align with the vision of the stakeholders and the Product Owner. By not being present, they are losing the benefit of early feedback; they lose a chance to contribute, to better understand the problem space for which the product is being built, to hear stakeholders’ concerns or to voice possible concerns of their own about how the product is being built.


<h2 class="question">
<span>Question:</span>
A Development Team, arguing it is self-organising, indicates it no longer needs the Daily Scrum; they collaborate throughout the day and they feel it has become a needless ritual. 
</h2>

Daily Scrum is a powerful event that helps the team catch up, inspect collectively their progress towards the sprint goal, and plan the work for the day. It should help the team keep focus on the sprint goal, and keep the current state of the work in the open, which speaks to the Scrum values of focus and openness. So, if the team does not see the value in this event, and thinks that it has become a needless ritual, it is important to understand why. Pay attention to how they run their daily scrums — the Scrum Guide says that the Daily Scrum is an event for developers; but does not discourage the Scrum Master from attending and inspecting. Make the Daily Scrum the topic of the next Sprint Retrospective, and collect detailed feedback from developers.

In my experience, the most common way the Daily Scrum can go wrong is that it turns into a status report meeting, in which developers report — often to a manager — what they did yesterday and what they are going to do today. This format rarely works, keeps the focus of every developer’s attention on him- or herself, and does not promote collaboration or reinforce collective awareness of the progress towards the sprint goal. Developers who participate in the scrum that is run this way do indeed often feel that they are participating in a needless ritual that is just wasting their time. If that is the case, suggest that the team runs their daily scrums differently. I personally have found it helpful to have a sprint board on display during the Daily Scrun, and to inspect the progress of the work visible on the board towards the sprint goal.


<h2 class="question">
<span>Question:</span>
The Product Owner asks the Development Team to pick up a very urgent item late in Sprint that was not forcasted, nor is it related to the Sprint Goal. The Development Team believes it can pick this up, as it is close to meeting the Sprint Goal, but this would involve not meeting their process improvement goal agreed upon during the last Sprint Retrospective. The Product Owner argues that, as it’s the highest priority to satisfy the customer, the needs of the customer have a higher priority than the process improvement goal for the team.
</h2>

The described scenario seems to violate the Scrum value of commitment, and also possibly respect; because it dismisses the actions agreed upon collectively by the team during a retrospective.

However, unplanned work is a common fact of life for many teams. What I would like to know about this situation is whether such unplanned work happens regularly, or is a one-off emergency. What I would also like to know is how strongly the developers feel about the process improvement goal; and why the Product Owner does think achieving this goal is important. Is there a way to put the process improvement goal in context for the Product Owner, so that he better appreciates its value? For example, will achieving the process improvement goal help with improving, or ensuring, the quality of the product; or help with speeding up development? Perhaps, if the Product Owner understands the purpose of the process improvement goal better, he will reconsider. Or perhaps the process improvement goal wasn’t that urgent in the first place, and can be postponed?

Finally, if the described scenario is likely to happen again, a suggestion from one of the creators of Scrum, Jeff Sutherland, is what he calls an _illegitimus non interruptus_ pattern (mock-Latin for “don’t let the bastards interrupt you”), which is to allocate a certain amount of developers’ spare capacity over the sprint to deal with such emergencies. The precise size of such a spare capacity buffer should be determined based on the historical data of such urgent requests introduced into the sprint.

<h2 class="question">
<span>Question:</span>
The CEO announces a ‘company event’. The event is scheduled to take place at the same time the Sprint Retrospective is scheduled. As not to ‘limit the impact of this event on the productivity’, the CEO instructs team to cancel, rather than pre- or postpone the Retrospective. She argues: “They have so many anyways, and this new unique event is also somewhat of an informal gathering”.
</h2>

Several observations.

One, things are bound to happen that will conflict with the planned Scrum events. All we can do is adapt to such events when they happen.

What I am observing in this scenario, however, is that the CEO is not quite on board with the agile transformation of the company. Her instinct is still to instruct teams about how they should work. This is micromanagement; whereas in Scrum, teams should be empowered to be self-managing, and thus decide for themselves how exactly they are going to adapt to changes. The CEO should not interfere with the inner workings of a team.

Now, how exactly to make this known to the CEO, is a challenge. Following the Scrum values of courage and openness, I would suggest going along with CEO’s decision to participate in the company event if she sees value in it; but also to explain to her that retrospectives are an important part of how the teams work; that they help the teams get more productive by addressing problems that are slowing the team down; that they are short (typically, 1.5-2 hours for a two-week sprint), and do not impact productivity; however, that missing them, risks not discovering and addressing problems in a timely manner, and that might actually slow the team down.

Whether the CEO trusts and respects the Scrum Master to heed to his advice, is a different question.

<h2 class="question">
<span>Question:</span>
HR is requesting the Scrum Master to provide input for a performance review for one of the members on the team (because Scrum Master is assumed to be closest to the day-to-day performance of people on the team).
</h2>

This is a tough question. The ideal of a Scrum team is that work gets done collaboratively, so that individual team members don’t get singled out. It is not the job of a Scrum Master to track individual performance of the members of a scrum team. Scrum Master is not a line manager; he does not make hiring or firing decisions. Often Scrum Master is not even technical enough to be able to make an informed decision about the performance of a given team member.

Having said that, why is HR interested in that particular member of the team? Is it a problem member? Although scrum teams are self-managing, it is difficult for a team to expel one of its members, as people naturally tend to avoid confrontation. If Scrum Master’s role is to remove impedimends for the team, won’t the team be best served by agreeing to provide an honest review for that team member?

<h2 class="question">
<span>Question:</span>
During a Sprint, the Development Team realises an item it selected in the forecast is much more complex than estimated. With approval from the Product Owner the Development Team changes it for an item it thinks it can finish.
</h2>



- That's totally fine
- Product Owner is responsible for maximizing the value

## A Scrum Team implements a process improvement goal that is not in line with organisational policy and standards. They argue they are self-organising and should be able to break with the ‘old ways’ through small controlled experiments.

- This is totally fine. In fact, this is great.
- Does the team understand the purpose of the organisational policy and standards, and the consequence of breaking them?

## The Product Owner is highly conservative over who gets access to the Product Backlog which is maintained in a personal spreadsheet. He argues that if anyone wants to have access to information about the Product Backlog they can talk to him directly or join in on scheduled Product Backlog refinement sessions.

- No transparency ("openness")
- Why is this happening?
- The team does not have an input

## A Development Team discusses that due to the absence of a Development Team member it no longer has all the skills required to deliver a working “Done” increment according to the definitions of “Done”. It wants to adjust the definitions of “Done”.

- Hire a new team member, or acquire the skill?

## Just prior to the Sprint Review a Development Team member determines some aspects of a process deviate outside acceptable limits, and that the resulting product will be unacceptable.

- Inspect the product

## During a Sprint Review, when the Development Team is answering questions about the increment, there is a discussion related to work on a specific Product Backlog Item that is not considered “Done” by some. The Development Team members that worked on the item are in disagreement. Some argue it is “Done”, others argue it is not.

## The Product Owner doesn’t understand the estimate given by the Development Team regarding a Product Backlog item. The Product Owner is surprised to learn that the items is deemed very complex. The Product Owner refers to an earlier ‘similar’ Product Backlog item, which was not complex at all.

## Decisions to optimise value and control risk are made based on the perceived state of the artefacts. What events and practises can improve transparency over the artefacts? Explain why.

## What risk is introduced if not all Development Team members are present for the Daily Scrum?

## The Product Owner insists on participating in the Daily Scrum so as to keep informed of the status and progress of development.

## The Product Owner suggests to postpone the Sprint Planning as she hasn’t yet been able to process all the feedback from the Sprint Review into the Product Backlog. She argues it makes no sense to plan the Sprint if the Product Backlog isn’t in a transparent state.
