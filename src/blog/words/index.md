One of the words that I hear all too often, and the meaning of which I do not quite understand is _politics_.

Your politics, his politics, their politics, my politics...

"I am a liberal," I hear people reaffirm in online conversations. Or, more rarely: "I am a concervative."

Why people rush to stick a label on themselves is quite beyond me. What people mean when they say these things is also rather unclear. John McWhorter once [proposed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmcqcyyR1Y0) to discard two words from the political lexicon, "because they make it almost impossible to have clear discourse about things that really matter", and one of such words, much to my surprise (I was expecting him to say _fascism_) was _liberalism_. The other, by the way, was _socialism_.

What these words remind me of are two things: one, frequently mentioned, is religion; the other, pointed out far less frequently, is sports fans. I remember my bewilderment as a schoolboy when I learnt from several of my classmates of the symbolism, the scarves, and the chants associated with football teams — something that I never cared about, before or since. Political discourse seems to be full of the same kind of tribal markers.
