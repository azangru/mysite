## The Story
We all have our stories of how we ended up doing what we do. Here is mine.

I started late (an ever-present reason to feel guilty for being so hesitant and slow).
I got my own personal computer when I was 16; and for a long time regarded programming
as something extremely clever approachable only to the mathematically minded. I remember
thinking longingly, around the time I graduated from the high school, how awfully smart were
the guys who were about to enter the School of Computational Mathematics and Cybernetics
at the Moscow State University. Myself, I went to a medical school. I had been preparing
for it for two years, and at the time it seemed like the only practical option.

I pivoted twice exploring what I wanted to do with my life. The first pivot happened a couple of
years after I graduated from the medical school (yes, I completed all six years of medical
training, slowly realizing that I had no intention of practicing medicine). I was
working at a genetics laboratory in Denmark, going through the depressing everyday routine of
mixing solutions for molecular reactions and getting frustrated by experiment after unsuccessful
experiment. That was the time when I first dabbled with web development. Our university
had a free license for _Adobe GoLive_ (it was 2004, I believe); our laboratory needed
a web page; so I tried to put something together. The result was pretty horrible.
Luckily, it never went online.

My main distraction from the depressingly unsuccessful lab work at that time was translation.
I had started translating medical texts from English into Russian while still studying at the med school,
but I had also begun translating fiction (thanks to Ekaterina Dobrohotova-Maikova, who encouraged
my early attempts, and to Vladimir Bakanov, who gave me books to translate). So by the time I
eventually snapped and quit the lab, my ambition was to translate. And for that,
I thought, I needed a proper training. A training in the humanities, and especially
in my native language that I was translating into, i.e. in Russian. So I went ahead
and applied to the School of Philology at the Moscow State University, department of the Russian
language and Russian literature. To my amazement and delight, I was accepted.

That, I realize in retrospect, was a mistake. An education in linguistics improves
one’s understanding of how language works, and disabuses one of various common misconceptions,
but does very little in terms of improving one’s translation skills. Instead of spending five rather
interesting years in studies of various aspects of the Russian language and the history of the
Russian literature, as I ended up doing, I could have probably discovered my passion for programming much
earlier. Sadly, by now, five years after graduation, I have forgotten most of whatever philology
I learned, and am reminded of that period mostly by nightmares, in which I am about to take
an exam on literature, but had not read a thing.

This brings me to my second pivot. Looking back, I recognize it for the trivial cliché that is was,
but at the time I was blissfully unaware that this was exactly what numerous unsatisfied
middle-aged people were doing. Still, looking back at it, it feels surreal, and I can hardly believe
I managed to pull it off. Working part-time as a proofreader for a digital agency, I learned about
a company they had once been partners with, called _General Assembly._ General Assembly had
established a number of coding bootcamps internationally, and was advertising its Web Development
courses. Among various campuses there was one in London, to which I applied and — miraculously —
got accepted. Another miracle happened at the British border, due to an irregularity in my papers.
The thing was that General Assembly, being a private company and not an academic institution,
was not in a position to support me in receiving an academic visa, while a regular tourist visa
had a (then unknown to me) limitation regarding the number of days one could study while in Britain.
The limit was 30 days, while the bootcamp’s duration was 3 months. All that I learned in an
interrogation room at a British airport. Incredibly, unbelievably I was let through,
with a stern warning never to do so again.

So, from April to July 2014 I studied at General Assembly’s Web Development Immersive program
designed to prepare full-stack web developers. It started with backend development,
focusing on ruby and the Ruby-on-Rails framework, and then proceeded to frontend development,
teaching us some JavaScript, Coffeescript, jQuery, Underscore.js, and, as a finishing touch, a
little bit of Backbone.js. Those were perhaps the happiest months in my life. I was in London,
a place where I had most wished to be, hearing people speak the language I most wished to hear,
learning a new profession that promised to be empowering, challenging, and well-paid.
It was only when I returned to Russia and started applying to jobs and getting rejected
that I realized how little I knew and how junior a developer I was. “We are not looking
for junior developers,” was a standard reply. So I was relieved when I finally received
an offer from a small startup working on a script that could be embedded in other
sites and would show an invitation to share the web page after the user would do
a certain action (such as scroll to the end of the page or click on a link to navigate
away from the page). Yes, that sounds pretty awful and intrusive, and something that
I as a visitor to that web site would not appreciate, I know; and for that I am sorry.
On the plus side though I did get some real-world experience. I am also happy to report
that that particular project has since gone out of business.

My work at that startup, as well as my... should I say remote internship, for the lack
of a better word, at a US-based company _EHR.works,_ made me realize that I needed — no, I
wanted — to learn more JavaScript; that the training I got at the bootcamp was very
much insufficient, and that some seriously interesting stuff was happening in frontend
development, which was constantly changing and becoming more and more logic-intensive.
So in the summer of 2015 I took another three-month course at a coding bootcamp — this
time remotely and focusing exclusively on JavaScript development.

The training I received at that second bootcamp, US-based _Hack Reactor_, along with
the experience I got during my first junior year, allowed me to get a job as a frontend
developer first at _Rutube_ (a Russian video streaming company, which at some point
viewed itself as a direct competitor of Youtube; hence the name), and then at
_Bookmate,_ where I am currently employed.

## Lessons from Studying at Coding Bootcamps

> Did they teach me everything I need to know about data structures and algorithms? No.

> Did they help me get my first programming job? Sort of, but not really.

> But I did learn an enormous amount of practical knowledge in a very short time...

### Web Development Immersive at General Assembly

#### What has it taught me?
Web Development Immersive was my true introduction into programming.
I had taken some online courses before, such as CS50 on EdX, or some Python courses on
EdX and Coursera, but I still was extremely new to software development when I
joined Web Development Immersive. Looking back now, I think of it as a foundational
course, where I learned the basics of programming, a server-side language and a
client-side language, principles of the MVC architecture, and the beauty of having
a mature framework (such as Ruby on Rails) that takes care of your common development needs.

#### What has it NOT taught me?
By the end of the course, I was not aware of the depth of my ignorance. I did
not have any devops/sysadmin training (apart from using a service such as Heroku).
I had no idea about mobile web development, and was not even trained to think
about mobile as a platform with its own specific requirements. I knew next to nothing about
testing (just that it was supposed to be useful; we had, overall, only about a day or so devoted
to testing, so I was very confused on that subject). On the frontend side,
I knew how to use jQuery, underscore and SCSS, but not much else. I had very little
knowledge of the native browser API, or of CSS methodologies. Most importantly, I had not had a chance
to think about how to architect web applications, how to structure code, how to deal with
the pains of growing the code base, how to employ principles of object-oriented design,
or what benefits might functional programming offer. Essentially, I only knew my (rather limited) way
around a (basic) Rails app. And I thought I was such a hot shot!

### Hack Reactor
A year after graduating from General Assembly’s Web Development Immersive, I applied
to Hack Reactor’s remote program. By that time, I had had a chance to work on a couple
of Rails apps and an Angular-based client-side app, been exposed to testing, and
started watching conference talks pretty regularly. I was hoping this program would
both help me review the fundamentals and teach me the bleeding edge of JavaScript development.

### What has it taught me?
Hack Reactor’s 12-week program is divided in half: the first 6 weeks, students study the
same materials and learn the fundamentals of JavaScript, as well as its main applications
on the client and on the server; the other half they apply this knowledge working on projects
of their own choosing. We had a great time implementing basic data structures
in JavaScript. We pair programmed every day, which I absolutely loved. Also, the learning
process was tightly coupled with test-driven development: we were given exercises with
specs that needed to be implemented, and learned the concepts by writing code that would
make tests pass. Also, here I for the first time properly learned about Node, and Express,
and D3.

### What has it NOT taught me?
Although a great experience in general (10/10 would recommend, as they say on Reddit),
Hack Reactor was disappointingly conservative when it came to technologies that were
taught to the students. To my dismay, in summer 2015, the curriculum did not include ES6 and
related tooling, or Typescript (which was gaining in popularity), but did have a module on
Coffeescript (which seemed so 2013!). It did not include React (although it was already
taking the world by storm), or Polymer, or Angular 2 (which, admittedly, was still
in alpha, but which, everyone knew, was coming), but did include Angular 1 (which,
everyone knew, was on its way out). It did not specifically teach Webpack or npm scripts,
but did include Grunt. In other words, the curriculum was a couple years behind the
bleeding edge, and to me that was painful.

## Whither now?
It’s the end of 2017, and the trends that interest me the most (and in which I have
very little to no experience) are:

- Progressive Web Apps (or, to avoid marketing terms, the modern mobile web in general),
which try to solve the performance problem of web applications on mobile.
The exciting part about this direction is new browser api's, such as service workers
or web workers, as well as strategies for smarter delivery of static assets to the client.

- GraphQL, or making client-side apps completely in control of what they receive from
the server. I have been burned frequently enough by our ever-changing json api's to
want to dive deeper into this.

- Type safety and functional programming. After a year of working with Backbone apps, and
with Rails apps before that, I tend to think in object-oriented terms. I appreciate
class instances as bundles of data co-located with methods operating on this data,
but I am also very much intrigued by the beauty of functional programming, and desperately
want the safety guarantees offered by statically typed languages. I am torn between
the beauty of Purescript, the practicality of Typescript, the ease of Flow, and the
hype of ReasonML. At the same time, I recognize that each of those options will bring
their own problems.

- Functional reactive programming, or programming with observables. This is tightly
connected to the previous point — just as functional programming, RxJS looks not only
crazy powerful, but *beautiful*, too.

Painfully, these trends seem to go in their own different directions and not form a
clear coherent story. Functional programming in JavaScript works well with reactive
programming, but at the same time functional type-safe languages, such as ReasonML,
do not seem particularly interested in reactive programming. Progressive web apps
rely on the native web platform as much as possible, to save on the size of JavaScript bundles,
whereas the functional school of thought dislikes the native solutions for being impure, non-
composable and so on (dislike towards the native promises and async-await is a good example
of this), and favors concepts implemented in additional libraries.

All this is pretty confusing and exhausting, and contributing to the sense of JavaScript
fatigue, but I still hope to get a chance to get deeper into all this.
