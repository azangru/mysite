Hi!

My name is Andrey, and this website is my little personal space on the Internet.

I work as a web developer — frontend, mostly. Which means that I get easily excited by such words as JavaScript, Typescript, React, RxJS, progressive web apps, and so on. I am guilty of falling for hype, but in the end I do tend to listen to the voice of reason.

Now for a whirlwind tour around the site. For me, it serves the purpose of social media,
only without the "social" part. The [diary](/diary/) section is something of a microblog
(and tends to morph into a collection of useful links found during the day that I would
like to be reminded about), while the [blog](/blog/) section takes care of lengthier scrivenings.
No mechanism is provided for leaving comments. Hello Web 1.0, my old friend!

I am a bit of an anglophile — no matter which part of the English-speaking
world this "anglo-" is coming from, — and there was a period in my life when
I nourished this passion by translating medical textbooks and fiction from English
into Russian. The list of these translations, which can be found on the
[publications](/publications/) page, reminds me of those fond times. (Eventually,
I took pity both on the authors and on the readers, and decided to indulge my passion
in a more harmless manner).

What I am most emphatically *not*, as must be painfully obvious from the first glance
at the site, is a designer. To all those whose esthetic feelings I offend by
the choice (or lack thereof) of typeface, or font-size, or font color, or by page layout,
or by myriads of other details, I apologize. At work, my hands would be guided by
a professional designer, but here I am left to my own devices.
