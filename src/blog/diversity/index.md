## Background
If I am remembering correctly, I have come across the issue of diversity only after I have switched my professional interests to web development and started actively following dev-related discussions on the Internet. I was amazed to find out that there were several ideological characteristics among many (perhaps most of) developers that I wasn't previously aware about. Perhaps this is related to different intellectual traditions in modern US and modern Russia, or perhaps while I wasn't looking (and avoiding social media) I missed a major cultural shift. These ideological characteristics are:

- An acute perception that certain social groups have been treated unfairly by the society. This might be correlating with a wide spread (or approval) of feminism among the young generation. (I, in contrast, do not have either such an acute feeling of social injustice, or particular sympathies towards feminism.)

- An imperative to act to fix these injustices, although this is perhaps the perennial feature of the young generation. (In contrast, it is more natural for me to observe and wait and let the society improve itself in its own time.)

- Strong sympathies towards the historically disadvantaged groups.

It has been said that US colleges (and they are probably the strongest influence on opinions of the young generation) are strongly left-leaning, and “progressive”. This feels like a new secular religion, which includes among its doctrines a teaching of diversity.

It is this teaching, or more specifically how it manifests in everyday discourse that I wanted to talk about. But first, I must account for my biases. I am white (no surprise there, for a Russian). I am a cisgender male. Socioeconomically, I belong to the middle class, and I have a university education. In other words, I belong to a privileged group which, according to the widespread opinion, should either support the dogma of this new secular religion, or shut up.

Of course, it’s a little more complicated than that. As a Russian national, I am stuck in a backward country that is relatively isolated from the rest of the world and which, due to the latest political developments, is becoming more and more of an outcast; so I do feel a certain degree of injustice in being born here. Besides, with every passing year I am getting closer to feeling another kind of discrimination, particularly prevalent in tech industry, which is ageism. So it's not like I am at the top of the social pyramid unable to grasp the concept of social injustice.

Nevertheless...

## Diversity as a Word
It comes as no surprise that words change their meaning. The word _minority_, for example, is often used not in its strict quantitative sense, but as a rather specific umbrella term encompassing specific racial (blacks), ethnic (Hispanic in the US), religious (Muslim in the US) and gender (women, homosexuals, transgenders) groups. The word _progressive_, as I mentioned before, refers not simply to any supporter of progress, but to those who, to quote a dictionary, "support social and political change that aims to make a system fairer." (This is giving me no end of grief, because I feel this word, with its halo of positive connotations, has been unfairly appropriated by a particular political group. I too would regard myself as “progressive,” only in my case that would mean a strong proponent of technological progress, which is not what the word has come to mean.) Likewise, the word _diversity_ is not generally used to mean _any_ social diversity. It does not imply that a collective should consist of nationals of every country. Or that it should include people of all ages. Or that it should contain members of all religions. This word is typically restricted to the groups of people who are included in the word _minority_. It is not usually spelled out in discussions. It is implied.

For me, who still, out of habit, perceives the word _diversity_ literally, it is bizarre. It also weakens one of the arguments for diversity, specifically that the variety of viewpoints helps build better products, because it is not _any_ variety the proponents of diversity are pushing for, but a specific kind of variety. And yet,  there it is.

> We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company.
We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin,
gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.

## Descriptive Approach to Diversity
Statements about diversity (and here I am focusing only on diversity in tech) can be of one of the two kinds: either descriptive or prescriptive. Descriptive statements simply describe the state of affairs. For example, one can point out that the percentage of women in tech is much smaller than the percentage of men. Robert Martin (aka Uncle Bob) likes to do the following demonstration during his talks: he would ask his audience to stand up, then for non-programmers to sit down, then for "those who are carrying only one X-chromosome" to sit down ([link](https://youtu.be/X31Jc6HQUcs?t=44s)). The demonstration is intended to make the numerical difference between male and female programmers stand out. Uncle Bob would then say how in the days of his youth (when programming was still done on mainframes using punch cards) the number of female programmers exceeded the number of male programmers, but he would not go further. He wouldn't declare it a problem or preach how to solve it.

From the descriptive standpoint, I am pretty indifferent to the composition of a collective. I get annoyed when these descriptive observations are then used to provide explanation for the observed frequencies, which is a pretty common exercise that people would engage in, particularly if they have a political agenda. One school of interpreters would insist that this numeric inequality is a sign of ongoing discrimination, which must be eliminated. Others would say that this unequal distribution reflects inherent biological (or psychological) differences between men and women, and therefore is OK. None of this is of particular interest for me.

What troubles me is the other, prescriptive, approach towards diversity.

## Prescriptive Approach to Diversity
In this approach, diversity, narrowly understood as a high proportion of "minorities" in a group, is regarded as a goal in itself. Here are just a few of a countless examples of this approach in action:

- a [tweet](https://twitter.com/sebmck/status/895640889770389504) by Sebastian McKenzie):

> Found out about this conf after @thejameskyle linked me to their "influencers list" which is entirely white men. Appalling speaker diversity for what is titled as the "international JavaScript conference".

- a quote from [Hack Reactor's Diversity and Inclusion Report](http://hrhqdir.s3.amazonaws.com/hr/diversity-reports/hack-reactor-diversity-report-2017.pdf):

> By Q1 of 2020, Hack Reactor’s graduating class will be made up of
50/50 gender balance and 20% underrepresented people of color.

- a [tweet](https://twitter.com/estellevw/status/938101138280161280) by Estelle Weyl:

> If you're a man, especially a white man, and you're invited to do a podcast, be an ally. Check the history of the podcast. If there is no diversity in previous lineups, decline the invite and give them referrals to women and other URMs, and give them a talking to as well. Thx.

- from a discussion on Frontend Happy Hour podcast ([episode 51](http://feeds.soundcloud.com/stream/401747517-front-end-happy-hour-episode-051-gin-and-toxic-culture.mp3), February 18 2018, at approx. minute 8), a response to the question, what one looks for in a company when deciding whether it's a good fit for them:

> — I look for a diverse team. That means that you have not just we are talking about the races or their socioeconomic background, but are they varied in their thought, cause diversity of thought is important in building a healthy company. So it’s like "yeah, we’ve got a healthy culture," but if it's all just like white dudes from, like, Harvard who all went to the same class together, I am like, "you may all be, like, the coolest and the most chill people in the world, but, like, you can’t tell me it's a healthy culture, because it’s a monoculture, and that’s not the strongest thing." So, a good diverse team, I think, is the foundation of a good culture.
>
> — Yeah, I think it builds a better product, too

This prescriptive approach, this imperative to have diversity is confusing to me, because I do not understand why exactly it is so desirable; why it is thought of as mandatory instead of as optional. Here are the reasons that I expect the defenders of this idea to put forth.

### This is a universal law
> In Federalist no. 2, John Jay highlights the lack of diversity in the colonies by writing: "Providence has been pleased to give this one connected country to one united people--a people descended from the same ancestors, speaking the same language, professing the same religion, attached to the same principles of government, very similar in their manners and customs". (The Politically Incorrect Guide to American History, the beginning of the audio fragment on Amazon: https://www.amazon.com/Politically-Incorrect-Guide-American-History/dp/0895260476)

### Competitive advantage: diverse teams are more likely to build products that are well-suited for the largest possible audience

This is speculative: I am not sure there exists strong data (apart from anecdotal evidence) suggesting that a diverse team of, say, backend web developers, or database specialists, or devops specialists will be more effective than a non-diverse team. No doubt, if a web development team is concerned with, let's say, web accessibility, the resulting web app will be more suitable for use by people with disabilities, but it does not follow that therefore this team should have members with all kinds of disabilities who will have first-hand experience of developing and using the web app.

In fact, I was surprised to see Steven Pinker write:

> ...economically egalitarian countries like Sweden and France differ from lopsided countries like Brazil and South Africa in many ways other than their income distribution. The egalitarian countries are, among other things, richer, better educated, better governed, and more culturally homogeneous, so a raw correlation between inequality and happiness (or any other social good) may show only that there are many reasons why it’s better to live in Denmark than in Uganda.

Notice how "more cultural homogeneity" in this passage correlates with happiness? Isn't this surprising? Doesn't it go against the diversity dogma?

_(Just to make myself clear, far be it from me to suggest that diversity is contributing to unhappiness or to company's failure; all I am saying is, I am not sure there exists the evidence to convincingly argue the opposite point.)_

- quotas (race / gender)


I.e. the difference between "how to function in a diverse group" vs "we need to make this group more diverse"

## Example from Frontend Happy Hour

— I look for a diverse team. That means that you have not just we are talking about the races or their socioeconomic background, but are they varied in their thought, cause diversity of thought is important in building a healthy company. So it’s like "yeah, we’ve got a healthy culture," but if it's all just like white dudes from, like, Harvard who all went to the same class together, I am like, "you may all be, like, the coolest and the most chill people in the world, but, like, you can’t tell me it's a healthy culture, because it’s a monoculture, and that’s not the strongest thing. So, a good diverse team, I think, is the foundation of a good culture.
— Yeah, I think it builds a better product, too

(think also: paradox of tolerance, of diversity)
[also re. monoculture: what about groups specifically for women, or for gay people? aren’t they monoculture?]

— Let's say a company has problems with their C-level (chief-executive level) suite. They get rid of that and then bring in new leadership. Can the culture change?
— I think they have to do more than just remove the C-level group. They have to remove everyone that were accomplices. And that’s maybe not just the C-level; that’s management-chain people that were involved in it, so that the remnants of that culture are kind of removed completely, and I think that’s really hard.
(ibid, about min. 32)


— National Symphony organization, they were like hey, why are like 90 percent of people in orchestras dudes? So what they did is they instituted blind interview, where you just... you rehearse... you perform before like the panel, but there's a curtain up, and they can't see what happened, they can't see who you are, and... these are people who like they cared about diversity, but they found that when they instituted this panel, this blind judge, women increased by 40%.

— Another thing happened recently too, the open-source community did it in software engineering, where they kind of obfuscated the usernames of Github contributors in pull requests, and all of a sudden like... maybe not the exact number, but, like, you know, a surprisingly high number of women's pull requests were accepted in lot of open-source projects.
(Frontend Happy Hour, episode 51, minute 39)

## From panel at Portland State University
We are not seeing anyone argue that there should be more female iron smelters, right? No-one is arguing
for a correction of the sex ratio in fields that aren't deemed lofty.

## Possible interpretation

The only way for me to make sense of the diversity movement is this. Somehow, perhaps due to the spread
of liberal ideals, the affluent strata of the white population became ashamed of their affluence, and
of the "privileges" that helped them attain this position. They perceive this as unfair, so to compensate,
they are trying to pull people from less prosperous strata into their environment. The narrative of diversity
as a generaly more successful way of doing business, or a friendlier environment to work in, is just a
distraction.

If that is the case, I get it. What saddens me are: 1) propaganda, and 2) perception of jobs as means for
getting a better socioeconomic standing, not as a calling that attracts truly passionate and focused individuals
who can overcome the obstacles life throws in their way.

## Language Diversity

The fewer languages there are, the more knowledge is accumulated in the remaining languages, and the fewer barries
there are for accessing this knowledge. For example, currently the English language enjoys the situation when a huge
(perhaps the largest) number of book titles, or journals, or films are released in this language. Consequently,
anyone who understands English has access to all this wealth of knowledge and culture. If (a hypothetical scenario)
a language disappeared, and people who might have spoken it instead joined the pool of English speakers,
it would have more (in absolute terms) people who could generate knowledge and share it in this language.

(Compare whatever is currently published in Russian with whatever is published in English — the latter is much
more abundant and important.)
