<p>If I am remembering correctly, I have come across the issue of diversity only after I have switched my professional interests to web development and started actively following dev-related discussions on the Internet. Somewhat to my surprise, I started observing certain ideological characteristics among many (perhaps most of) developers. The reason that it was surprising might be due to objective differences in socio-intellectual milieu of the modern US and the modern Russia (Jonathan Heidt seems to think that the years since 2012 were particularly seminal for social justice activism), or just to me missing a major cultural shift in the social media I wasn’t following. These ideological characteristics are:</p>
<ul>
<li>An acute perception that certain social groups have been treated unfairly by society. This might be correlating with the popularity of feminism among the younger generation. (I, in contrast, do not have either such an acute feeling of social injustice, or particular sympathies towards feminism.)</li>
<li>An imperative to act to fix these injustices, although this is perhaps the perennial feature of the young generation. (In contrast, my natural attitude is that of an observer rather than a reformer.)</li>
<li>Strong sympathies towards the historically disadvantaged groups.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have since come to recognize this as a manifestation of the left (or “progressive”) politics that seems to be getting more and more support recently. This feels like a new secular religion, which includes, among its doctrines, a teaching of diversity.</p>
<p>It is this teaching, or more specifically how it manifests in everyday discourse that I want to address here. But first, I must account for my biases. I am white (no surprise there, for a Russian). I am a cisgender male. Socioeconomically, I am probably middle class (although a recent Russian <a href="https://www.rbc.ru/newspaper/2018/06/19/5b27bf829a794710796bbfe5">survey</a> made me doubt that), and I have a university education. In other words, I belong to a privileged group which, according to the widespread opinion, should either support the dogma of this new secular religion, or shut up.</p>
<p>Of course, it’s a little more complicated than that. As a Russian national, I am stuck in a backward country that is relatively isolated from the rest of the world and which, due to the latest political developments, is becoming more and more of an outcast by the day; so I might claim I suffered an injustice of being born here. Besides, with every passing year I am getting closer to experiencing another kind of discrimination, particularly prevalent in tech industry, which is ageism. So it’s not like I am at the top of the social pyramid unable to grasp the concept of social injustice.</p>
<p>Nevertheless…</p>
<h2>Diversity as a Word</h2>
<p>It comes as no surprise that words change their meaning. The word <em>minority</em>, for example, is often used not in its strict quantitative sense, but as a rather specific umbrella term encompassing certain racial (blacks), ethnic (Hispanic in the US), religious (Muslim in the US) and gender (women, homosexuals, transgenders) groups. The word <em>progressive</em> (that I am particularly uncomfortable with) refers not to <em>any</em> supporter of progress, but to those who, to quote a dictionary, “support social and political change that aims to make a system fairer.” (This is giving me no end of grief, because I feel this word, with its halo of positive connotations, has been unfairly appropriated by a particular political group. I too consider myself “progressive,” only in my case that would mean a strong proponent of technological progress, which is not what the word has come to mean.) Likewise, the word <em>diversity</em> is not generally used to mean <em>any</em> social diversity. It does not imply, for example, that a collective should consist of people from every country. Or that it should include people of all ages. Or that it should contain members of all religions. This word is typically restricted to the groups of people who are included in the word <em>minority</em>. It is not usually spelled out in discussions. It is implied.</p>
<p>For me, who still, out of habit, perceives the word <em>diversity</em> literally, it is bizarre. It also weakens one of the arguments for diversity, specifically that the variety of viewpoints helps build better products, because it is not <em>any</em> variety the proponents of diversity are pushing for, but a specific kind of variety. And yet, there it is.</p>
<p>Here is a recent example, from an <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2018-04-27/revolut-ceo-on-expansion-plans-and-hiring-strategy-video">interview</a> of the CEO of <em>Revolut</em> on Bloomberg TV (1:30–1:40):</p>
<p><em>Interviewer:</em> “Where do you find best engineering talent?”</p>
<p><em>He:</em> “We hire in London, we hire across the whole Europe, we hire in Russia, we hire in Poland as well”</p>
<p><em>Interviewer:</em> “And are you focused on diversity at all?”</p>
<p>At this point, one might have pointed out that hiring in the UK, in other Western European countries, in Russia, and in Poland already makes the team pretty diverse by bringing together people with different backgrounds. But of course the interviewer meant a different kind of diversity.</p>
<h2>Descriptive Approach to Diversity</h2>
<p>Statements about diversity (and here I am focusing only on diversity in tech) fall into one of two categories: descriptive or normative (prescriptive). Descriptive statements simply refer to the state of affairs. For example, one can point out that the percentage of women in tech is much smaller than the percentage of men. Robert Martin (aka Uncle Bob) likes to do the following <a href="https://youtu.be/X31Jc6HQUcs?t=44s">demonstration</a> during his talks: he would ask his audience to stand up, then for non-programmers to sit down, then for “those who are carrying only one X-chromosome” to sit down. The demonstration is intended to make the numerical difference between male and female programmers stand out. Uncle Bob would then say how in the days of his youth (when programming was still done on mainframes using punch cards) the number of female programmers exceeded the number of male programmers, but he would not go further.</p>
<p>From the descriptive standpoint, I am pretty indifferent to the composition of a group. I did not have particular problems studying in a medical school, which was fairly gender-balanced, or studying in a school of philology, where the gender ratio very skewed towards the female side, or working in software companies, which are predominantly male. I am bewildered by the zeal with which some people try to explain the observed imbalances. One school of interpreters would insist that this numeric inequality is a sign of ongoing discrimination, which must be eliminated. Others would say that this unequal distribution reflects inherent biological (or psychological) differences between men and women, and therefore is OK. None of this is of particular interest for me.</p>
<p>What troubles me is the other, normative, approach towards diversity.</p>
<h2>Normative Approach to Diversity</h2>
<p>In this approach, diversity, narrowly understood as a high proportion of “minorities” in a group, is regarded as a goal in itself. Here are just a few of the countless examples of this approach in action:</p>
<ul>

</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>from a discussion on Frontend Happy Hour podcast (<a href="http://feeds.soundcloud.com/stream/401747517-front-end-happy-hour-episode-051-gin-and-toxic-culture.mp3">episode 51</a>, February 18 2018, at approx. minute 8), a response to the question on what one looks for in a company when deciding whether it’s a good fit for them:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>— I look for a diverse team. That means you have not just… we are talking about, like, the races or their socioeconomic background, but are they varied in their thought, cause diversity of thought is important in building a healthy company. So it’s like “yeah, we’ve got a healthy culture,” but if it’s all just, like, white dudes from, like, Harvard who all went to the same class together, I am like, “you may all be, like, the coolest and the most chill people in the world, but, like, you can’t tell me it’s a healthy culture, because it’s a monoculture, and that’s not the strongest thing.” So, a good diverse team, I think, is the foundation of a good culture.</p>
<p>— Yeah, I think it builds a better product, too.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This prescriptive approach, this imperative to have diversity is confusing to me, because I am not sure I understand the argument about why it is so desirable, and why it is thought of as mandatory instead of optional. Here are the reasons for diversity that I have heard.</p>
<h3>It is self-evident that a diverse group is better than a non-diverse group; it is universally true</h3>
<p>It may perhaps be a strawman, but the argument that the virtue of diversity is a self-evident truth is shattered by the understanding of how much this attitude is a product of our time. As pointed out in the very beginning of the audio fragment of <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Politically-Incorrect-Guide-American-History/dp/0895260476">The Politically Incorrect Guide to American History</a>,</em> there was a time when the opposite of diversity was celebrated as a great advantage of a society:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In Federalist no. 2, John Jay highlights the lack of diversity in the colonies by writing: “Providence has been pleased to give this one connected country to one united people—a people descended from the same ancestors, speaking the same language, professing the same religion, attached to the same principles of government, very similar in their manners and customs”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, those words were written a long time ago, and perhaps people were more clueless then. But here is Ben Shapiro, during a Q and A session after his talk at Yale University, when asked to comment about the social success of the Scandinavian countries, <a href="https://youtu.be/w6iWqsE-fW8?t=44m14s">saying</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The first thing that is important to notice about the Nordic countries is that the Nordic countries are by and large extraordinarily ethnically homogeneous, so they are not comparable [with the US]… and culturally homogeneous as well. Vermont looks like Norway, right? Bernie Sanders’s philosophy works in Vermont and works in Norway…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, ok, Ben Shapiro is a conservative, and conservatives may be confused. But, to my surprise, here is Steven Pinker <a href="http://bigthink.com/big-think-books/steven-pinker-enlightenment-now-inequality-happiness">playing a very similar tune</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…economically egalitarian countries like Sweden and France differ from lopsided countries like Brazil and South Africa in many ways other than their income distribution. The egalitarian countries are, among other things, richer, better educated, better governed, and more culturally homogeneous, so a raw correlation between inequality and happiness (or any other social good) may show only that there are many reasons why it’s better to live in Denmark than in Uganda.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Notice how “more cultural homogeneity” in this passage correlates with happiness? Isn’t this surprising? If diversity is such a powerful force for good, then how come ethnic and cultural homogeneity are presented as advantages?</p>
<h3>Economical argument: it is in the interest of a company to have diverse teams, because they offer competitive advantage by reaching the largest possible audience</h3>
<p>This is a commonly voiced carrot kind of an argument. Here, for example, is <a href="https://youtu.be/-rH-W483sUg?t=33m30s">Kyle Simpson presenting it on JavaScript Air</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think we can probably all agree that the constituency that is served by the tech industry, meaning just about the entire world’s population, is, by definition, incredibly diverse. And we can also admit that is’s a really tiny percentage of us that are actually participating in the building of the stuff that the rest of the world consumes. So it stands to reason that the more diverse those teams are, the better they can address those concerns…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think there are at least two weaknesses in it. First, it is speculative. While I can see how this might be true for the overall design of the product, or for the directly user-facing parts of the product, I am finding it hard to believe that a diverse team of, say, backend web developers, or system administrators, or database administrators, or devops specialists will exclusively by the virtue of being diverse be more effective than a non-diverse team. Moreover, is it necessarily the case that, for example, frontend developers tasked with making their site more accessible, will do a poorer job if their team does not include people with disabilities? I doubt that.</p>
<p>Second, if diversity is so beneficial for businesses, then there is no need to worry about it at all; the market will do all the work by itself, selecting for better performing (and therefore, according to this argument, more diverse) companies. As Jordan Peterson put it in an <a href="https://youtu.be/aMcjxSThD54?t=20m48s">interview on BBC Channel 4</a>:</p>
<p><em>Peterson:</em> It could be the case that if companies modified their behavior and became more feminine, they would be successful. But there is no evidence for it. I am not either doubtful or undoubtful, but there is no evidence for it.</p>
<p><em>Interviewer:</em> So why not give it a go?</p>
<p><em>Peterson:</em> Well, it’s fine. If someone wants to start a company and make it more feminine and compassionate, let’s say, and caring in its overall orientation towards its workers and towards the marketplace, then that’s a perfectly reasonable experiment to run. My point is that there is no evidence that those traits predict success in the workplace.</p>
<p>Just like Jordan Peterson above, I am not saying that diversity is contributing to company’s failure; all I am saying is, I am not sure there exists convincing evidence to argue that it is necessary for a company’s success.</p>
<h3>Ethical argument: as a society, we need to recognize the historical injustice in preventing certain groups from attaining positions of power and pay back to these groups their due</h3>
<p>While it’s a self-evident truth that there are historically disadvantaged groups in our society, and while I completely agree that this is unjust, I see two possible developments of this argument. One emphasizes the equality of opportunity; it argues for removal of artificial barriers that closed off certain career paths for certain social groups. It puts emphasis on meritocracy, with the talented and the hard-working succeeding. A fair criticism of this approach is that the level playing field that it’s advocating for is an unattainable fiction; that members of a disadvantaged group start from a worse position than the members of a privileged group, and that we are already biased. Here are a couple of examples from  Frontend Happy Hour podcast (<a href="http://feeds.soundcloud.com/stream/401747517-front-end-happy-hour-episode-051-gin-and-toxic-culture.mp3">episode 51</a>, at approx. 39 minutes):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>National Symphony organization, they were like hey, why are like 90 percent of people in orchestras dudes? So what they did is they instituted blind interview, where you just… you rehearse… you perform before like the panel, but there’s a curtain up, and they can’t see what happened, they can’t see who you are, and… these are people who like they cared about diversity, but they found that when they instituted this panel, this blind judge, women increased by 40%.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Another thing happened recently too, the open-source community did it in software engineering, where they kind of obfuscated the usernames of Github contributors in pull requests, and all of a sudden like… maybe not the exact number, but, like, you know, a surprisingly high number of women’s pull requests were accepted in lot of open-source projects.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It all makes sense. But the alternative is to enforce affirmative action, impose a reverse discrimination, which is to reward (i.e. to accept, to hire, to promote, etc.) people not solely on the basis of their professional characteristics (that they have direct responsibility and control over), but also on the basis of their physical and social status (their gender, their sexual orientation, their ethnicity, etc.). This alternative tells me that if I have two equally qualified candidates for one position, I should select the one from with a more disadvantaged background — the selection criterion that is completely irrelevant for their future performance at work and that feels intuitively unfair towards the other candidate.</p>
<h2>Other problems with the normative approach</h2>
<h3>It is not attacking non-diverse collectives if they consist of representatives of disadvantaged groups</h3>
<p>A common trend in tech is study groups or meetups exclusively for women or ethnic and gender minorities. It’s not that I object against these groups as such, but it seems to me that their very existence presents an argument against the virtues of diversity and the undesirability of a monoculture.</p>
<h3>It focuses on specific observable traits</h3>
<p>Talks about diversity almost always center around several recognizable physical traits, namely gender and race/ethnicity. Sometimes they would also include people with disabilities. There is little to zero emphasis on the diversity of thought (which might not necessarily go hand in hand with the diversity of gender or of ethnicity/race). Critics of companies’ hiring practices or of the makeup of conference panels comment almost exclusively on gender and skin color; not on the areas of expertise of individuals.</p>
<p><em>(This, of course, can present a problem only for the argument that diversity is an intellectual and economic good. It has no consequence for the argument that diversity is an ethical imperative.)</em></p>
<h3>It focuses on high-paying jobs or on historically disadvantaged groups</h3>
<p>If the normative approach towards diversity were consistent, it would insist on diversity in every single job, but that of course is not the case. As Heather Heying <a href="https://youtu.be/VCrQ3EU8_PM?t=32m55s">said</a> at the panel “We Need to Talk About Diversity”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are not seeing anyone argue that there should be more female iron smelters, right? No-one is arguing for a correction of the sex ratio in fields that aren’t deemed lofty.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Heather Mac Donald <a href="https://youtu.be/zS_RtvrsoIs?t=25m35s">made</a> a similar point:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nearly 82 percent of obstetrics and gynaecology medical residents in 2016 were female, but no-one is complaining about gender bias against males.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The only way for me to make sense of the diversity movement is this. Somehow, perhaps due to the spread of liberal ideals, the affluent strata of the white population became ashamed of their affluence, and of the “privileges” that helped them attain this position. They perceive this as unfair, so in order to compensate, they are trying to pull people from less prosperous strata into their own. The narrative of diversity as a generally more successful way of doing business, or a friendlier environment to work in, is just a distraction.</p>
<p>What saddens me about this interpretation are: 1) propaganda, and 2) perception of jobs as means for getting a better socioeconomic standing, not as a calling that attracts truly passionate and focused individuals who can overcome the obstacles life throws in their way.</p></div></main></div></div></div><script id="gatsby-script-loader">/*<![CDATA[*/window.pagePath="/blog/diversity/";/*]]>*/</script><script id="gatsby-chunk-mapping">/*<![CDATA[*/window.___chunkMapping={"app":["/app-260166a50770f219cc0b.js"],"component---src-templates-blog-post-js":["/component---src-templates-blog-post-js-4fb639bb24af2d8f8d15.js"],"component---src-pages-about-index-js":["/component---src-pages-about-index-js-54448caef69165d33622.js"],"component---src-pages-blog-index-js":["/component---src-pages-blog-index-js-dcc2044b506b60f810ed.js"],"component---src-pages-diary-index-js":["/component---src-pages-diary-index-js-581292cbbd619776f05e.js"],"component---src-pages-index-js":["/component---src-pages-index-js-fbb2049274c144632196.js"],"component---src-pages-publications-index-js":["/component---src-pages-publications-index-js-142c56253b62cacf3639.js"]};/*]]>*/</script><script src="/mysite/component---src-templates-blog-post-js-4fb639bb24af2d8f8d15.js" async=""></script><script src="/mysite/commons-3e60a55efe37e8ba232f.js" async=""></script><script src="/mysite/styles-7b4c31f3595c60ee727c.js" async=""></script><script src="/mysite/app-260166a50770f219cc0b.js" async=""></script><script src="/mysite/webpack-runtime-3bdbd83ffd2ae85862d6.js" async=""></script></body></html>
