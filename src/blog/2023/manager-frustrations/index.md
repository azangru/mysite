Here’s the thing.

I am a front-end developer. And I have a line manager directly above me. And I do not understand what it is that he is supposed to do. I do not understand his role, and how it is supposed to help our team.


## Our web team
There is a so-called nine-year rule in our org, which is that people are hired on a three-year contract that can only be extended twice. Three years, plus three years, plus three years. Then you are out. This rule makes us continuously bleed knowledge and experience. It also meant that our previous manager, when he reached the nine-year limit, had to leave. And the org was looking for a new manager.

Here is the thing though. Our web team is small. There was a time when, for not very good reasons, it consisted of a back-end team, and a front-end team. Both teams had a manager. The total head count was about 15 people. But then, by the time our previous manager had to leave, the count dropped to either seven or eight people. It was at that point where our org started looking for a new front-end team manager.

It was also becoming quite clear that the separation of the web team into a front-end team and a back-end team was a bad idea. But, technically, the teams were still separated at the time the org announced the opening. We have since both dropped in size to six developers, and have merged our two subteams into one. Six developers, and two managers. Why?!

## My previous manager
My previous manager had a background in biological sciences (I cannot remember whether it was biochemistry or biophysics), and had also been managing the web team for a long time. He had experience. He could empathise with website users. He understood — while we were undertaking a journey of website rewrite — which parts of the site were valuable. He could think of edge cases against which he could test the UI. So, despite not being trained in UI development, he brought a lot of value in subject matter knowledge. I understood what to talk about with him, and I got value out of our conversations. I hope we both did.

## Search for a new manager

Here is something that I have to confess. I was involved in the assessment of the candidates for the new opening. There were three of us — a back-end subteam manager, a back-end developer, and me, a front-end developer, who held one a technical interview round with the candidates. We were only given 45 minutes per candidate. We did not have a clear idea what we were testing them for. Should a manager be a developer himself? Should he have experience in front-end development in particular? Should he understand problems of front-end development? Should he have management experience? What do we ask? We had so many things to talk about, and only 45 minutes per candidate. The best we could do is to confirm that the candidate had some technical knowledge. The candidate who advanced to become our manager had not been a front-end developer himself; but he had management experience. The candidates who had been front-end developers didn't have managerial experience; and so they were rejected.

There was an important moment from that experience that I still remember. The back-end developer who was part of our tech knowledge testing panel said in the end that his concern about the candidate was that he will just become a requirements gatherer. That he will be told what to do, and will, unquestioningly, bring that to the team. I was surprised. I did not get that signal from the interview at all; and did not know how, or why he sensed that. But that comment turned out to be prophetic.



- go-between, requirements gatherer
- not a disruptor, or a change agent; unquestioningly follows the rules of the org
- observes the hierarchy
- little pushback
- no value to the team; could have just been on leave all the time, and nothing would change 
- goes to same meetings as the other (back-end team) manager
- as a team, we are fairly mature; we communicate; we work together; we work towards sprint goal; what is the value of a manager in this situation?
- little understanding of the subject matter
- he brings the best value when he works as a developer
