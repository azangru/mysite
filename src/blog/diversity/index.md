## Prescriptive Approach to Diversity

- quotas (race / gender)


## Example from Frontend Happy Hour

— I look for a diverse team. That means that you have not just we are talking about the races or their socioeconomic background, but are they varied in their thought, cause diversity of thought is important in building a healthy company. So it’s like "yeah, we’ve got a healthy culture," but if it's all just like white dudes from, like, Harvard who all went to the same class together, I am like, "you may all be, like, the coolest and the most chill people in the world, but, like, you can’t tell me it's a healthy culture, because it’s a monoculture, and that’s not the strongest thing. So, a good diverse team, I think, is the foundation of a good culture.
— Yeah, I think it builds a better product, too

(think also: paradox of tolerance, of diversity)
[also re. monoculture: what about groups specifically for women, or for gay people? aren’t they monoculture?]

— Let's say a company has problems with their C-level (chief-executive level) suite. They get rid of that and then bring in new leadership. Can the culture change?
— I think they have to do more than just remove the C-level group. They have to remove everyone that were accomplices. And that’s maybe not just the C-level; that’s management-chain people that were involved in it, so that the remnants of that culture are kind of removed completely, and I think that’s really hard.
(ibid, about min. 32)


— National Symphony organization, they were like hey, why are like 90 percent of people in orchestras dudes? So what they did is they instituted blind interview, where you just... you rehearse... you perform before like the panel, but there's a curtain up, and they can't see what happened, they can't see who you are, and... these are people who like they cared about diversity, but they found that when they instituted this panel, this blind judge, women increased by 40%.

— Another thing happened recently too, the open-source community did it in software engineering, where they kind of obfuscated the usernames of Github contributors in pull requests, and all of a sudden like... maybe not the exact number, but, like, you know, a surprisingly high number of women's pull requests were accepted in lot of open-source projects.
