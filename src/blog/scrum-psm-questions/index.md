Below are some scrum-related questions from a [forum thread](https://www.scrum.org/forum/scrum-forum/35525/psm-iii-sample-questions-review-and-feedback) about exam questions for the PSM III certificate. They aren’t lifted off of an actual exam question bank; but are sufficiently interesting that I thought I’d have a go at answering them.  


<h2 class="question">
<span>Question:</span>
One of the Scrum events is the Sprint Review. How does the Sprint Review enable empiricism? What would the impact be if some members of the development team were not present? 
</h2>

Empiricism means being guided by experience and by observation of the state of the world as it stands; and no other Scrum event embodies the spirit of empiricism better than the Sprint Review. In it, the Scrum team gets together with the stakeholders to inspect the increment added to the product over the course of the last sprint, and the state of the product as it currently is. It also offers an opportunity to reflect on the world in the context of which the product is being built. Over the course of the Sprint Review, the Scrum Team gets feedback on whether the stakeholders believe that the team is building the right product; whether they are building it correctly; and whether any of the priorities in the building of the product have changed. This allows the Scrum Team to correct their course early and to avoid wasted effort.

Ideally, all members of the Scrum Team should be present at the Sprint Review. Of course the presence of the Product Owner is crucial; because he is the person responsible for the direction in which the product is going, and for the order in which it is being built. But developers benefit from this event too. It is when they get a chance to collectively reflect on the development of the product as a whole; to better understand its place in the world; to listen to stakeholders; to ask them questions; and to better align with the vision of the stakeholders and the Product Owner. By not being present, they are losing the benefit of early feedback; they lose a chance to contribute, to better understand the problem space for which the product is being built, to hear stakeholders’ concerns or to voice possible concerns of their own about how the product is being built.


<h2 class="question">
<span>Question:</span>
A Development Team, arguing it is self-organising, indicates it no longer needs the Daily Scrum; they collaborate throughout the day and they feel it has become a needless ritual. 
</h2>

Daily Scrum is a powerful event that helps the team catch up, inspect collectively their progress towards the sprint goal, and plan the work for the day. It should help the team keep focus on the sprint goal, and keep the current state of the work in the open, which speaks to the Scrum values of focus and openness. So, if the team does not see the value in this event, and thinks that it has become a needless ritual, it is important to understand why. Pay attention to how they run their daily scrums — the Scrum Guide says that the Daily Scrum is an event for developers; but does not discourage the Scrum Master from attending and inspecting. Make the Daily Scrum the topic of the next Sprint Retrospective, and collect detailed feedback from developers.

In my experience, the most common way the Daily Scrum can go wrong is that it turns into a status report meeting, in which developers report — often to a manager — what they did yesterday and what they are going to do today. This format rarely works, keeps the focus of every developer’s attention on him- or herself, and does not promote collaboration or reinforce collective awareness of the progress towards the sprint goal. Developers who participate in the scrum that is run this way do indeed often feel that they are participating in a needless ritual that is just wasting their time. If that is the case, suggest that the team runs their daily scrums differently. I personally have found it helpful to have a sprint board on display during the Daily Scrun, and to inspect the progress of the work visible on the board towards the sprint goal.


<h2 class="question">
<span>Question:</span>
The Product Owner asks the Development Team to pick up a very urgent item late in Sprint that was not forcasted, nor is it related to the Sprint Goal. The Development Team believes it can pick this up, as it is close to meeting the Sprint Goal, but this would involve not meeting their process improvement goal agreed upon during the last Sprint Retrospective. The Product Owner argues that, as it’s the highest priority to satisfy the customer, the needs of the customer have a higher priority than the process improvement goal for the team.
</h2>

The described scenario seems to violate the Scrum value of commitment, and also possibly respect; because it dismisses the actions agreed upon collectively by the team during a retrospective.

However, unplanned work is a common fact of life for many teams. What I would like to know about this situation is whether such unplanned work happens regularly, or is a one-off emergency. What I would also like to know is how strongly the developers feel about the process improvement goal; and why the Product Owner does think achieving this goal is important. Is there a way to put the process improvement goal in context for the Product Owner, so that he better appreciates its value? For example, will achieving the process improvement goal help with improving, or ensuring, the quality of the product; or help with speeding up development? Perhaps, if the Product Owner understands the purpose of the process improvement goal better, he will reconsider. Or perhaps the process improvement goal wasn’t that urgent in the first place, and can be postponed?

Finally, if the described scenario is likely to happen again, a suggestion from one of the creators of Scrum, Jeff Sutherland, is what he calls an _illegitimus non interruptus_ pattern (mock-Latin for “don’t let the bastards interrupt you”), which is to allocate a certain amount of developers’ spare capacity over the sprint to deal with such emergencies. The precise size of such a spare capacity buffer should be determined based on the historical data of such urgent requests introduced into the sprint.

<h2 class="question">
<span>Question:</span>
The CEO announces a ‘company event’. The event is scheduled to take place at the same time the Sprint Retrospective is scheduled. As not to ‘limit the impact of this event on the productivity’, the CEO instructs team to cancel, rather than pre- or postpone the Retrospective. She argues: “They have so many anyways, and this new unique event is also somewhat of an informal gathering”.
</h2>

Several observations.

One, things are bound to happen that will conflict with the planned Scrum events. All we can do is adapt to such events when they happen.

What I am observing in this scenario, however, is that the CEO is not quite on board with the agile transformation of the company. Her instinct is still to instruct teams about how they should work. This is micromanagement; whereas in Scrum, teams should be empowered to be self-managing, and thus decide for themselves how exactly they are going to adapt to changes. The CEO should not interfere with the inner workings of a team.

Now, how exactly to make this known to the CEO, is a challenge. Following the Scrum values of courage and openness, I would suggest going along with CEO’s decision to participate in the company event if she sees value in it; but also to explain to her that retrospectives are an important part of how the teams work; that they help the teams get more productive by addressing problems that are slowing the team down; that they are short (typically, 1.5-2 hours for a two-week sprint), and do not impact productivity; however, that missing them, risks not discovering and addressing problems in a timely manner, and that might actually slow the team down.

Whether the CEO trusts and respects the Scrum Master to heed to his advice, is a different question.

<h2 class="question">
<span>Question:</span>
HR is requesting the Scrum Master to provide input for a performance review for one of the members on the team (because Scrum Master is assumed to be closest to the day-to-day performance of people on the team).
</h2>

This is a tough question. The ideal of a Scrum team is that work gets done collaboratively, so that individual team members don’t get singled out. It is not the job of a Scrum Master to track individual performance of the members of a scrum team. Scrum Master is not a line manager; he does not make hiring or firing decisions. Often Scrum Master is not even technical enough to be able to make an informed decision about the performance of a given team member.

Having said that, why is HR interested in that particular member of the team? Is it a problem member? Although scrum teams are self-managing, it is difficult for a team to expel one of its members, as people naturally tend to avoid confrontation. If Scrum Master’s role is to remove impedimends for the team, won’t the team be best served by agreeing to provide an honest review for that team member?

<h2 class="question">
<span>Question:</span>
During one sprint review, a customer representative appreciated the feature; however, in the very next review, he/she expressed confusion about the value it is expected to create. This situation can be frustrating for the team. How would you handle it?
</h2>

This may either be a normal occasional occurrence, or be a symptom of some dysfunction. Why did the customer representative express favorable opinion about a feature one sprint review, and then changed her mind in the next one? Was she focused during the previous review? Did she consciously approve a feature, or mechanically and without thinking? Also, why did this feature get included into the sprint? Was the product backlog ordered appropriately? Is the product owner in sufficiently close contact with the customer?

If this is a rare occurrence, I would advise looking at it from the bright side. Ideally, the Product Owner should be able to justify the value of each of the product backlog items; but if this is not the case, and if the customer representative is still unsure about the value of a feature, this might suggest that the feature indeed was not important enough, in which case it is fortunate that this has been caught early. Use this opportunity to inspect the Product Backlog together with the customer representative and confirm with them that they still believe that the items in the top of the backlog, which are likely to be taken into the next sprint, are valuable.

Have a talk with the Product Owner about how the feature that the customer representative was confused about ended up in the sprint; and whether there is anything that can be done to prevent this from happening in the future. Perhaps the Product Owner has problems with prioritizing the backlog properly?


<h2 class="question">
<span>Question:</span>
When commitment is not demonstrated in a member of the scrum team, how might this impact other scrum values necessary for achieving the sprint goal?
</h2>

To review: scrum values are focus, courage, commitment, openness, and respect. Scrum values were first outlined in Ken Schwaber’s and Michael Beedle’s book _Agile Software Development with Scrum_ in 2001, and added to the Scrum Guide in its 2016 revision (a good discussion of them, by Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland, can be found in [this episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hRZffDD1ec) of _Scrum Pulse_).

One other Scrum value that is almost guaranteed to suffer in the absence of commitment, is this person's focus towards achieving the goal. A lack of commitment is also likely to put into question their respect towards the people who have set the goal. It is also possible that this team member will become less open about their work, and will lack courage to contribute towards its improvement.

<h2 class="question">
<span>Question:</span>
During a Sprint, the Development Team realises an item it selected in the forecast is much more complex than estimated. With approval from the Product Owner the Development Team changes it for an item it thinks it can finish.
</h2>

My feeling is that there is nothing wrong in the described scenario. An undone item would not have brought any value to the product; therefore, the Product Owner, whose role it is to maximize product value, together with the team adapted to these newly arising circumstances by choosing a backlog item that the team expects to finish, thus increasing the value of the product.

At the end of the sprint, the team will do well to discuss this development in a retrospective. Perhaps they will identify what has caused the overly optimistic forecast of the item; and will get better at recognizing complexity of work. However, practice shows that, because development work is complex, estimations are very frequently wrong, which is why the growing opinion is that we should stop doing estimates.

<h2 class="question">
<span>Question:</span>
A Scrum Team implements a process improvement goal that is not in line with organisational policy and standards. They argue they are self-organising and should be able to break with the ‘old ways’ through small controlled experiments.
</h2>

While it is certainly true that a slow-moving organization may have outdated policies and standards in place that are better retired, it is also possible that the existing policies and standards in fact serve an important, though non-obvious, purpose and must be followed to the letter. For example, some of such standards may exist to ensure legal compliance of the company, in which case meeting them should in fact become part of the definition of done for product backlog items.

Scrum Master needs to make sure that both he and the team undertsand the purpose of the policies and standards that the team suggests skipping.

<h2 class="question">
<span>Question:</span>
The Product Owner is highly conservative over who gets access to the Product Backlog which is maintained in a personal spreadsheet. He argues that if anyone wants to have access to information about the Product Backlog they can talk to him directly or join in on scheduled Product Backlog refinement sessions.
</h2>

The behaviour of the Product Owner is in contradiction with the Scrum value of openness. The Product Backlog is one of the Scrum artifacts that should be visible both to the team and to stakeholders. Having access to the product backlog lets both team members and stakeholders know what work and in which order is planned for the product, and enables them to provide timely feedback if necessary.

The Scrum Master should speak to the Product Owner to find out why this is happening. Is the product a secret?

<h2 class="question">
<span>Question:</span>
A Development Team discusses that due to the absence of a Development Team member it no longer has all the skills required to deliver a working “Done” increment according to the definitions of “Done”. It wants to adjust the definitions of “Done”.
</h2>

The purpose of the Definition of Done is to serve as a test for whether a shippable Increment has been achieved. If the team wants to adjust the Definition of Done, inspect it with the team, and ask them to reflect on why it was the way it was, and whether the loosened Definition of Done will still meet the product requirements.

The likely answer to this question in this scenario will be a no. Indeed, it follows from the description of the scenario that if the Development Team member were present, the team would work towards the old Definition of Done.

This situation reveals a team dysfunction and opens up several courses of action. The dysfunction is that there is only one team member that can do a certain kind of work, and in the absence of that person, the team is blocked. The actions open to the team are to either learn what the now missing member was doing, or to find a replacement for that person, or both.

<h2 class="question">
<span>Question:</span>
Just prior to the Sprint Review a Development Team member determines some aspects of a process deviate outside acceptable limits, and that the resulting product will be unacceptable.
</h2>

The findings of the Development Team member should be discussed during the Sprint Review. The Sprint Review is the event for inspecting both the outcome of the Sprint, and the current state of the product; and the discovery of a team member that due to some defects in the process the product will be unacceptable should be addressed collectively as quickly as possible.

<h2 class="question">
<span>Question:</span>
During a Sprint Review, when the Development Team is answering questions about the increment, there is a discussion related to work on a specific Product Backlog Item that is not considered “Done” by some. The Development Team members that worked on the item are in disagreement. Some argue it is “Done”, others argue it is not.
</h2>

The dysfunction illustrated in this scenario is that the Scrum team does not have a clear shared understanding of the Definition of Done. This needs to be addressed quickly; one good place is the nearest Sprint Retrospective.

There remains, however, the question how to facilitate the ongoing Sprint Review where team members are in disagreement about whether a certain backlog item is “done”. Ask the team members who argue that the item is not done to elaborate on why they think so; and ask the Product Owner if any of these concerns should be addressed immediately in the next Sprint.

<h2 class="question">
<span>Question:</span>
A Developer suggests that given Scrum is about being a lightweight framework that removing some Events would make it even lighter. How would you respond to this? What might the impact be if Events were removed from the framework?
</h2>

Scrum events are a way of empirical agile product management, which help the team improve collaboration both within itself and with business stakeholders, help the team stay focused on the goal, frequently inspect the product, plan their work, and improve their processes.

If a developer suggests removing any of the events, first, I would be curious to know which events they would like to remove and why. Does the developer not receive any benefit from those events? Do they feel that these events are a waste of their time? Learning this may help reveal the dysfunctions about how the Scrum framework is implemented by this particular team.

Secondly, I would raise this with the team during a Retrospective, trying to discover whether any other team members feel the same way about these events, and to understand the cause.

I would coach the team about the purpose of each of the Scrum events, and help facilitate them in a way that makes them valuable. Merely removing them risks losing the opportunities for transparency, inspection, and adaptation. 


<h2 class="question">
<span>Question:</span>
The Product Owner doesn’t understand the estimate given by the Development Team regarding a Product Backlog item. The Product Owner is surprised to learn that the item is deemed very complex. The Product Owner refers to an earlier ‘similar’ Product Backlog item, which was not complex at all.
</h2>



- Product Owner does not do estimation

## Decisions to optimise value and control risk are made based on the perceived state of the artefacts. What events and practises can improve transparency over the artefacts? Explain why.



## What risk is introduced if not all Development Team members are present for the Daily Scrum?



## The Product Owner insists on participating in the Daily Scrum so as to keep informed of the status and progress of development.

- Cool
- Pigs and chickens?

## The Product Owner suggests to postpone the Sprint Planning as she hasn’t yet been able to process all the feedback from the Sprint Review into the Product Backlog. She argues it makes no sense to plan the Sprint if the Product Backlog isn’t in a transparent state.

- Interesting
- Backlog refinement?
- Prioritize? Only important feedback needs to be urgent

<h2 class="question">
<span>Question:</span>
You are the Scrum Master for two teams, the Tigers and the Lions. Both teams work on the same product, and have chosen to use velocity to aid their capacity planning. One morning, you walk into the office and overhear a conversation between the two project managers. They are discussing which Scrum team adds more value to the customer. They propose to use the average velocity of the Tigers and Lions over the past twelve months to make their decision. Questions: 1) What is velocity? 2) does an increased velocity lead to increased value for the customer? 3) What actions would you take?
</h2>

Velocity is a commonly used notion in the Agile space, and is used to mean the amount of work done per unit of time. In the context of Scrum that would be the amount of work done but the Scrum team per sprint. Velocity is not a core Scrum concept, and thus does not figure in the Scrum Guide.

To calculate the "amount of work", it is common to count either the number of product backlog items completed over a sprint, or to translate the backlog items into a certain number of points according to some estimation technique.

An increased velocity may or may not lead to increased value for the customer. It would result in an increased value if the velocity was calculated as the number of product backlog items per sprint, and the product backlog were porperly ordered, with the most valuable items at the top. However, it is much more common to see the velocity calculated as "story points", which relate more to the amount of work needed to be done rather than to the value resulting from the work.

Velocity is very commonly gamed, which is why many practitioners advise against focusing too closely on it. Most importantly, if velocity is calculated in "story points", these should stay internal to the Scrum team and should by no means be used to compare teams against each other, because there is no standard against which they are calculated. I would try to explain this to the project managers.

P.S.: the feedback from a failed PSM3 exam that someone posted on reddit:

So I thought I was prepared..took and passed PSPO I, II, PSM I, II, etc.. I failed.. and I’m not sure I’m going to spend another $500. There were 35 questions. 10 or so we’re multiple choice. Result: Did Not Pass Score: 59.8% (91.5 points scored out of 153 maximum points)

Feedback:

Research the Scrum Guide on the importance of artifact commitments, specifically how they enhance transparency for their respective artifacts. https://www.scrum.org/resources/blog/scrum-guide-2020-update-commitments

What is the Product Owner's role in managing the Sprint Backlog? Who is responsible for keeping the Developers on track during the Sprint?

Research the concept of Product Value. How would you define value? Can value mean different things to the users, and to the organizations? In other words, are there different target audiences when it comes to value delivery?

Consider who is responsible for deciding whether or not a Product Increment is done. What happens if the Increment or one of the PBIs as being part of the Increment, is not done? How would you deal with that? Who decides on how to deal with that? What are the boundaries/rules of Scrum when it comes to deciding when and what to release? Are there any limitations to when a Scrum Team can release a Product Increment? And if so, what would that mean?

Research the concept of Business Agility. Why is it important to the Product Owner? What are the benefits of Business Agility to an organization, its Product Owners and the products/services they manage? In other words, consider what the value of Business Agility is.

Research the concept of Product Value. How would you define value? Can value mean different things to the users, and to the organizations? In other words, are there different target audiences when it comes to value delivery?

Research what type of actions might differ between the Scrum Master and the Product Owner when it comes to increasing transparency.

Consider how a Product Backlog might be constructed to maximize transparency. What are some key characteristics of a Product Backlog? Does Product Backlog have any commitment? And what about the characteristics of its Product Backlog items?

Consider which artifacts are impacted by the debt created when taking shortcuts and “not done” work. What does transparency mean in that case? What can the Scrum Team do to reinstate transparency?

There are many techniques, ways, tools and templates for creating transparency and understanding of the product vision. Research such techniques that can be used for describing and communicating the product vision and what purpose they each serve. Can specific techniques be used to achieve specific goals? Such as creating the product vision, or communicating the product vision, or visualizing the product vision?

Consider that innovation does not come for free. Organizations and Scrum Teams need to invest in order to gain innovation and to gain innovative capabilities. Research how a Product Owner can contribute to increasing the level of innovation. What could be measured, decided on or influenced by a Product Owner, to impact the level of innovation done in a Sprint?

Consider what makes Scrum artifacts transparent and how you can use the Scrum Guide and your experience with Scrum to support theory with practical examples.

If a Product Backlog is truly transparent, is there no benefit to be gained by a competitor that gets access to the backlog? If it provides no value to a competitor, what value is it providing to stakeholders?
