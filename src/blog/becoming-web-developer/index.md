## Introduction
We all have our stories of how we ended up doing what we do. Here is mine.

I started late (an ever-present reason to feel guilty for being so hesitant and slow).
I got my own personal computer when I was 16; and for a long time regarded programming
as some kind of magic accessible only to mathematically gifted. I remember thinking
longingly, around the time I graduated from school, how awfully clever were the guys
who went to the School of Computational Mathematics and Cybernetics at the Moscow State
University. Myself, I went to medical school. I had been preparing for it for two years,
and at the time it seemed like the only possible option.

I pivoted twice exploring what I wanted to do in life. The first pivot happened a couple of
years after I graduated from the medical school (yes, I completed all six years of medical
training, slowly realising that I had no intention of being a practicing clinician). I was 
working at a genetics laboratory, mixing solutions for molecular reactions and getting
beaten down by experiment after unsuccessful experiment. That was the time when I first dabbled
with web development. Our university had a free license for Adobe GoLive (it was 2004, I believe);
our laboratory needed a web page; so I tried to put together some static pages. They were pretty
horrible. Luckily, we never used them.

My main distraction from the depressingly unsuccessful lab work at that time was translation.
I had started translating medical texts from English into Russian while still studying at the med school,
but I had also began translating fiction (thanks to Ekaterina Dobrohotova-Maikova, who encouraged
my early attempts, and to Vladimir Bakanov, who gave me books to translate). So
