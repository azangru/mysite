I get easily excited by the words\nsuch as JavaScript (accompanied by the names of whatever latest features of the language\nhappen to be the most hyped up at the moment), React (accompanied by such words as functional programming,\nstateless components, recompose, server-side rendering, etc.), RxJS, progressive\nweb apps, and so on.</p>\n<p>Now a quick tour around the site. For me, it serves the purpose of social media, only without\nthe “social” part. The <a href=\"/mysite/diary/\">diary</a> section is something of a microblog (and tends\nto morph into a collection of useful links found during the day that I would\nlike to be reminded about), while the <a href=\"/mysite/blog/\">blog</a> section takes care of lengthier scrivenings.\nNo mechanism is provided for leaving comments. Hello Web 1.0, my old friend!</p>\n<p>I am a bit of an anglophile — no matter which part of the English-speaking\nworld this “anglo-” is coming from, — and there was a period in my life when\nI nourished this passion by translating medical textbooks and fiction from English\ninto Russian. The list of these translations, which can be found on the\n<a href=\"/mysite/publications/\">publications</a> page, reminds me of those fond times. (Eventually,\nI took pity both on the authors and on the readers, and decided to indulge my passion\nin a more harmless manner).</p>\n<p>What I am most emphatically <em>not</em>, as must be painfully obvious from the first glance\nat the site, is a designer. To all those whose esthetic feelings I offend by\nthe choice (or lack thereof) of typeface, or font-size, or font color, or by page layout,\nor by myriads of other details, I apologize. At work, my hands would be guided by\na professional designer, but here I am left to my own devices.</p>"}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":true}}}
