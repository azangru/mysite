## Scrum
- [Scrum.org](https://www.scrum.org/) — arguably, the most authoritative source on Scrum
- [Nigel Baker and Chet Hendrickson discuss the 2020 update to the Scrum Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9WZTg8uaiw)
- [Scrum.inc](https://www.scruminc.com). This is Jeff Sutherland’s site, which is in a much worse state than Scrum.org. However, it still contains valuable resources such as Jeff Sutherland’s explanation of the framework (see the playlist [here](https://www.scruminc.com/scrumlab-open/)), and a somewhat more detailed overview starting from [this page](https://www.scruminc.com/scrum-framework/) (and then one needs to follow the links in the ScrumLab Open section)
- [A Scrum Book](http://scrumbook.org/) — an effort by James Coplien, together with Jeff Sutherland et al., to write about Scrum in an analytical and academic sort of way.

### History
- [The New New Product Development Game by Hirotaka Takeuchi and Ikujiro Nonaka](https://hbr.org/1986/01/the-new-new-product-development-game) — an article in Harvard Business review in which the word “Scrum” appeared for the first time.

### Daily scrum
- A good [episode](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/podcast/6-how-to-make-the-daily-scrum-more-effective-with-julie-chickering) of the Agile Mentors podcast, talking about the daily scrum
- And, by the way, an [episode](https://youtu.be/_oIPrBcy6v4) of Your Daily Scrum, about running the daily scrum without the three questions

### Retrospectives
- [Various ideas for retrospective format](https://easyretro.io/retrospective-ideas/) at EasyRetro

### Mob programming
- [Mob Programming explained, a talk by Amitai Schleier](https://youtu.be/eLLOOmS-7pY)
- [Mob Programming 101, by Woody Zuill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4Eg-mnx9zg)
