## Background and my bias
Through most of my life I’ve been happily apolitical, and generally unaware of
hot topics discussed in the society. Perhaps focus on the studies (or work, or games,
or tech) helped: I did not have either time or interest to follow the news or listen
to political commentators. Here in Russia, I completely missed the news cycle of 1996
presidential elections (when Yeltsin was re-elected, reportedly in a rather dirty manner),
or the ascent of Putin to the position of prime minister, or the elections in 2000
(when he became president), and so on. Ditto for US or British politicians: I was
mildly amused by how George W. Bush was shown in cartoons, or by the excitement around
having the first African American president, but that’s about it.

It could have been Jon Stewart’s *The Daily Show*, or it could have been *Unfilter* by
Jupiter Broadcasting (a podcasting company that also ran *Linux Action Show*, which I was
much more interested in at the time) that gradually made me aware of the current
political topics. I think that happened some time between 2010 and 2014.
Which means that the US presidential campaign of 2016 was probably the first campaign
the news of which I followed regularly.

Of all the candidates in that campaign, I really liked Bernie Sanders. Especially
after hearing his [victory speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kbjo3SFLuc) after
the New Hampshire Democratic primary. To me, this was a sincere man, proclaiming noble
goals, having a sharp mind and no desire to play the ordinary political games. He
projected fairness and trustworthiness. He was very likable. It’s a shame that he
had to lose.

The two main candidates both seemed to me very unlikable. I had missed the news that
caused Hillary to be generally unliked (was it something to do with Benghazi? or something before
that?), but for me the one episode that was enough was her [response](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MaoNDzZ8Mw)
to a journalist’s question whether she had "wiped the server". Her response was,
"What, with a cloth or something?" The journalist persisted: "You know how it works digitally",
to which she replied: "I do not know how it works digitally at all". This exchange
showed her to be either an outright liar or an outrageously technologically illiterate
person. The prevalent sentiment that she should become a president *because* she was
a woman (pinnacled by Madeleine Albright famous
["There is a special place in hell for women who don’t help each other"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZCNhlmV-X0&t=30s))
didn’t help.

Now Trump gave an impression of a complete idiot. Particularly drastic was the contrast
between him and Bernie when both of them were giving victory speeches in New Hampshire.
Bernie talked about issues; Trump talked about himself. Bernie was eloquent; Trump,
incoherent. And yet, the closer the election date the more I wanted Trump to win —
if only to disrupt, to make things more fun to watch from afar. My argument would
have been similar to what Slavoj Zizek [articulated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZUCemb2plE):

> It was a very cynical reasoning. Because my hope was precisely that if Trump
> was elected president, everyone would be shocked, horrified at this horror, and
> something will happen, like Bernie Sanders and so on, in the Democratic party.

Living in Russia, I got used to despising our government, not listening to what
they have to say, and living a private life with a hope of never becoming an object
of attention of the state. I thought it would be cool if more people across the
world would grow disgusted with their governments and would learn to ignore them.
Althought it probably doesn’t quite work that way, as Jono Bacon pointed out:

> This is the thing that drives me nuts about people... Look, I don't like Trump,
> I can't stand him, I think he is an idiot; but on one hand you have people saying
> "He is such an idiot, he says such stupid shit", and then people say,
> in the next breath, "But look at what he said."

So yeah, here they are, my biases that can cloud my judgement in what I am going
to say below: I am Russian, and I disliked Hillary more than I disliked Trump. With
that said, let me move on to what drives me insane about this election — the story
of Russian meddling.



One of the things that really strikes me is that there are things that are alleged as, you know, traitorous illegal activities that, if you had asked me, is this traitorous or illegal, I would have said: "Doesn’t sound like it to me." For example, if the Russians had some dirt on Hillary, and if they offered it to the campaign, if you had asked me, without this news coverage in which we all learned how this works, is it illegal to gather information from someone who has information, I would say: "How is that illegal to talk to people? Why would it be illegal to know more, if it’s true, why would it be illegal to have true information?"
