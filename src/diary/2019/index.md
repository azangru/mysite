Tried `npm link` and `npm pack` to test a React component about to be published to npm locally. Couldn't make it work with `npm link`, but the `npm pack` technique proved very reliable. The idea is:

- first, run `npm pack` in the directory of the npm package you are testing (this will produce a tar.gz archive of the package);
- second, change to the directory of the project in which you want to test this package, and run `npm install <path to the package>`.

Works like a charm!

## January 20
- A [video course](https://youtu.be/ifGeR-4mzSM) that someone copied from Egghead about using very hardcore (Haskell-inspired) functional javascript to write a guessing card game. There is a companion [repo](https://github.com/Hawk94/anger-the-bunny), also copied from somewhere. The creator of this course, Ian Hofmann-Hicks, has a [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjvgv-FpMo7XvlfO8YKiz4_onf8WonhiA) with more goodness.
- An [amazing talk](https://youtu.be/JsvElHDuqoA) by Adam Neary from Airbnb about graphQL-based frontend tooling that they use, with a live demo.
- [Videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8bRyfU7ycLXnEBfvdorpUg/videos) from JamStack conf (late October 2018) are online. Could be meh, or could be interesting.

## January 7
