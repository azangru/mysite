[Reactivity](https://github.com/madeagency/reactivity) â€” an interesting practical
example of using bleeding-edge React technologies, such as:
- server-side streaming with `renderToNodeStream`;
- code splitting with `react-universal-component`;
- `redux-observable` with server-side rendering (thanks to `react-redux-epic`).

## January 3
[Razzle](https://github.com/jaredpalmer/razzle), an interesting project that
generates universal JavaScript apps.

Interesting [example](https://joelgardner.github.io/2017-07-13/part5-bnb-book-frontend-react-redux-saga/)
of combining redux-saga with Apollo (without using React-Apollo)
