Came across slides for the course Software Studio, about the lowly craft of web development, taught at MIT.

[Course page from 2013](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-170-software-studio-spring-2013/lecture-notes/)
[Course page from 2016](https://stellar.mit.edu/S/course/6/fa16/6.170/materials.html)


What’s curious, the 2013 course taught Ruby on Rails and SQL for backend development, while the 2016 course teaches Node and MongoDB. Also, a notable addition to the 2016 course is React (which just goes on to show how commonplace and inescapably default React has become; it truly is the new jQuery).

I was, however, shocked by this slide (from the lecture notes on React):

Never has the phrase "the view in MVC" (which has since generally been retired anyway, because it's not a fitting abstraction for thinking about React) been intended for use in the context of clients and servers; it has always intended to explain React’s place among other client-side MVWhatever frameworks.

A mostly disappointing 6-hour workshop on integrating Purescript into a JavaScript app by Hardy Jones
from the last LambdaConf. Disappointing firstly because Hardy mercilessly slaughters the ample time
he is given, moves excruciatingly slow and demonstrates very little, and secondly because the interop
between the Purescript and the JavaScript code looks rather ugly. As does the tooling:

On the bright side, here’s an inspiring (albeit a very high-level) [talk](http://www.oredev.org/2017/sessions/purescript-tomorrows-javascript-today)
about Purescript by a well-spoken Brit from a recent conference in Sweden:

Also, some [free lectures on React Patterns](https://reacttraining.com/patterns/) by React Training.

A [nice explanation](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39439653/events-vs-streams-vs-observables-vs-async-iterators/47214496#47214496)
of the differences between the push and the pull apis for consumption of async data by Google’s Domenic Denicola on Stack Overflow

Spent a long time looking wistfully at this job opening at BBC:
[Software Engineer (Web Developer)](https://careershub.bbc.co.uk/members/modules/job/detail.php?record=20625)
to work with BBC Moscow team. What discouraged me is that they are looking for
the sole developer (so it seems like more of a grunt kind of work).

What’s beautiful is that when this job opening announcement reached standard
online job boards (like [Headhunters.ru](https://hh.ru/vacancy/23422897)) it lost most
of the details of its description.

## November 11
Heard announcements of a couple of CS courses that will hopefully be freely available. These are:
- [Web programming with Python and JavaScript](https://cs50.github.io/web/)
- [Introduction to Game Development](https://cs50.github.io/games/)

## November 8
From Berkeley Martinez (the author of [react-redux-epic](https://github.com/BerkeleyTrue/react-redux-epic)),
an example of its use: a demo app called [React Shoppe](https://github.com/realworldreact/react-shoppe). Check
out branches that have rx in their names.
