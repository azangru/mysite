# About

Hi! My name is Andrey, and I am a web developer. The programming languages I am most comfortable with are Ruby and JavaScript. Some of the web projects I’ve been involved in, along with their short descriptions, are listed on the Projects page.

It has been a long journey getting to this point. I graduated from a medical school in Moscow (Russia), worked for a couple of years in a laboratory of medical genetics in Denmark, then came back to study the Russian language and literature in the Moscow State University, only to realize eventually that it is actually programming that I really want to be doing for a living. Along the way, I translated and edited a number of medical books and works of fiction from English into Russian. Those are showcased in the “Other” section of this site.

In April–July 2014, I took a three-month intensive course *Web Development Immersive* offered in the London campus of a coding bootcamp *General Assembly*, happily hacking away and learning Ruby on Rails and some JavaScript. Out of my academic interest to the Russian translations of Byron’s *Don Juan,* came the idea for the final project: a [website](http://donjuan.herokuapp.com) that shows parallel texts of the original Byron’s poem (annotated by Isaac Asimov, of the *Three Laws of Robotics* fame) alongside two of its best Russian translations (a brief story of which I tell in [this Youtube video](https://youtu.be/GQWlpVrULlw)).

A year later, hoping to experience the non-stop coding bliss again, I took another immersive coding course — this time, at *Hack Reactor Remote*. Here, I learned server-side JavaScript, and got more practice with client-side JavaScript frameworks, such as Backbone, Angular, and React. By the end of the course, I freaking loved JavaScript.

So yeah, this is where my story brings me. Time to go rock the world, I guess.
